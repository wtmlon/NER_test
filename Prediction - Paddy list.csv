466,matt@logrocket.com,"Matthew!?!LogRocket!?!In an unprecedented year that saw many teams shift to remote working, we asked tech and business leaders to pick their essential tools.
Throughout our Leaders Insights series on Siliconrepublic.com last year, we asked a host of tech and business leaders from Ireland and further afield to name the essential tools and resources that get them through the working week.
In a year that brought major disruption to most of our working lives, they turned to video conferencing, collaboration software and a whole lot of coffee.
Handy hardware
The move away from offices means many of us are now relying on tech devices for both work and keeping in touch. Seán Keating of Vilicom said his number-one tool is his smartphone. Its like the Swiss army knife of business tools. It keeps me on schedule, navigates to meetings, runs all our most important business apps, connects my laptop to our IT cloud, enables our Teams communications and more.
HPs Gary Tierney said that his phone and laptop are the must-have items for work, but since the arrival of Covid-19 he has been relying more on his laptop. Ive found that working from home has put an even greater emphasis on the criticality of my PC as a communication tool and a general workhorse.
Many people also had to figure out a new at-home work set-up last year. I recently invested in a 38-inch ultra-wide monitor and its been a game changer for me, Joe Lennon of Workvivo told us over the summer.
Video conferencing
2020 was the year we all became very familiar with Zoom (as well as Zoombombing and Zoom fatigue).
Amy Bunszel of Autodesk said she now spends most of her day on Zoom, and Patrick Horgan of Horizon8 said tools such as Zoom are proving incredibly helpful in the work-from-home dynamic.
But there are plenty of other alternatives out there. Microsoft Teams was highlighted as an essential daily tool by plenty of people, including SL Controls Keith Moran, CWSIs Ronan Murphy and Avanades Graham Healy.
Martin McKay of Texthelp said he couldnt be without the Google Meet and Chat tools at the moment, and Xilinxs Brendan Farley said Skype and Webex are other options being used for video calls.
Online collaboration tools are integral to not just our success but our basic functioning, added Ogie Sheehy of ViClarity. Whether it is Zoom or GoToMeeting, Google Chat or Microsoft Teams, these tools are enabling us to continue to work uninterrupted across a global footprint. 
Software saviours
While Microsoft Teams has seen a sharp rise in users in the past year, many companies have been relying on other products from the Microsoft 365 stack. Ronan Murphy of CWSI said these tools allow his company to do whatever we need to do from wherever we are.
SoftwareOnes Una Keeshan said she uses the focus plan in Microsoft MyAnalytics to set aside time for priority work, while Avanades Graham Healy said he uses Microsoft Dynamics for customer relationship management and Power BI for reporting, forecasting and analytics.
With teams dispersed, messaging and collaboration tools such as Slack also came to the fore. Its a convenient way to collaborate over projects and to organise ourselves according to different topics and business functions, said Oz Alashe of CybSafe.
Collaboration tools have always been important for developers. Joe Lennon of Workvivo said GitHub is fundamental for his engineering team to manage source code and code reviews, and they regularly use Tuple to do remote pair programming.
Jennifer Sethre of Intry said Intercom and LogRocket are important tools for her HR tech company, and Keith Moran of SL Controls turns to the Frankli platform for engaging with his team.
Lettertecs Frank Kelly uses Google Keep for jotting quick notes down as they occur, while ViClaritys Ogie Sheehy is a fan of the voice dictation app on his iPhone. It allows me to be immediately responsive to important emails that come through when I am out and about and away from my desk, he said.
A good old-fashioned to-do list
While there may be a fancy tech tool for everything, many leaders still rely on a simple to-do list to keep focused. Nessa McEniff of Learnovate said listing her priorities is a key part of the week and shes a bit of an obsessive list maker.
Netssos Brian ODoherty added that a having a clear list keeps him grounded. I set myself a weekly list and find that its a great way of keeping the faith in myself, my work and my ambitions, he said.
But Liz Cunningham of Google said she is still looking for the perfect tool that will manage all her to-do lists across personal and work life to help keep all the balls in the air.
PayPals Annette Hickey noted that her calendar helps keep her focused throughout the week, and Dells Jason Ward said an organised calendar is key to ensuring I am as productive as possible.
Keeping the mind clear
The sudden shift to remote working means that many have had to find new ways to focus, while still maintaining a good work-life balance and not overworking now that your kitchen may be your office.
To help with this, Nicole Sahin of Globalization Partners said she keeps Fridays free of Zoom meetings. Its like heaven to have that time to think and get things done.
Similarly, Codemas Donna Gartland said that, since the shift to working from home, she now blocks time in her calendar each week without meetings to focus and get deep work done. I use distraction blockers across all my devices, she added, such as Stay Focusd on my browser and Focus mode on Pixel.
Xilinxs Brendan Farley said he removed the work email app from his phone many years ago, which helps him switch off in the evenings. And Mark Cockerill of ServiceNow suggested having a great Spotify playlist on hand.
Getting away from the desk
For minding mental and physical health, many other leaders also suggested getting out and about. SL Controls Keith Moran enjoys a good game of squash in the evening, Arkphires Paul Nannetti tries to run on the beach a few times a week, and Fenergos Louise OConnell said that yoga or a walk in the fresh air can help to just clear the mind.
Una Keeshan of SoftwareOne has recently taken tennis back up as a hobby. The tennis is not only great exercise, she said, but also helps me clear my head from work or the stresses of the day.
And Autodesks Amy Bunszel said that, now she doesnt have a commute for the time being, its a bit easier to make time for exercise every morning and a nice dinner in the evening.
Food certainly plays a key part in the day for many. Horizon8s Patrick Horgan said the barbecue has proved an essential tool for bringing his family together in the current environment.

John Wiley &amp; Sons (A Shares) (NYSE:JW-A)Q1 2021 Earnings CallSep 03, 2020, 10:00 a.m. ET

<ul><li>Prepared Remarks</li><li>Questions and Answers</li><li>Call Participants</li></ul>Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Wiley's vice president of investor relations, Brian Campbell. Please go ahead.
Brian Campbell -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter 2021 earnings update. On the call with me are Brian Napack, president and chief executive officer; and John Kritzmacher, chief financial officer. A few reminders to start.
The call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. You shouldn't rely on these statements, as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our SEC filings. The company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Wiley provides non-GAAP measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends.
These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under GAAP. Please see the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures presented in the supplementary information included in our press release. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency, unless otherwise specified.
After the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. I'll now turn the call over to Wiley's president and CEO, Brian Napack. 
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Right now, educators and students around the world are heading back to school and researchers are heading back into their labs in a world significantly altered by COVID-19. As they do, they're rewriting the playbooks for education and research. From our vantage point,  It's clear that they're turning to digital content, platforms and services at unprecedented levels, and they're also turning to corporate partners, such as Wiley, who can help them achieve their goals in a changed world.
The result for Wiley is that across the company, demand for our digital products and services has grown markedly. This unusual moment is moving our markets and proving that the strategies that we have been pursuing are not only right for the market today, they are right for where the market is going in the long term. We had a solid first quarter of revenue and earnings performance despite the disrupted environment. This demonstrated both resilience of our business and tight alignment of our strategies with the market's evolving needs.
We'll talk specifics about our performance shortly, but  It's important to note that today's acute health, economic and social problems serve to reinforce the value of Wiley's mission. Over the past months, we've moved faster to validate and publish more research and have made thousands of critical COVID-related research studies freely available. We've helped many universities, schools and corporations around the world to more quickly migrate from traditional to virtual learning. And we spent lots of time in our communities, raised money for causes that address injustice and taking concrete actions to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion within Wiley.
We continue to be reminded of the racial inequality plaguing our society and the need for corporate citizens, such as us, to play an active role in dismantling it. Our global team takes great pride in the fact that their work is truly helping the world to heal, recover, and thrive. Wiley today remains largely in work-from-home mode, although we have partially opened a few offices around the world where local health conditions allow. I want to recognize the great work of our team in executing at a very high level through this challenging period.
Simply stated, the team continues to deliver on our key milestones and customer commitments. In regular surveys, the vast majority of our colleagues report feeling productive and happy, and their engagement is very high. This can be attributed to our strong mission-driven culture, our tech-enabled workflows and our consistent emphasis on colleague care. The pandemic continues to disrupt the global economy, and this has directly impacted some of our more traditional revenue sources, such as physical books and in person training.
But despite these focused headwinds, we're very encouraged by the underlying momentum we're seeing in education and research. This momentum should continue well beyond the pandemic. We've been talking for some time about the positive trends that are driving research and education. Our growth strategy is built on these trends.
I'm pleased to see that they are accelerating at this moment and that Wiley is capitalizing on them. Research output is rising rapidly. Demand for online education and for the digital courseware to support it is also rising rapidly. The acceleration in these areas speaks well to our long-term outlook.
Internally, we are using the moment to lean into our operational excellence. This includes a focus on improving content workflows, our customer journeys our facilities' footprint and more. John will talk about this later, but there is much we have done and much that we continue to do to improve the efficiency of operations. With that, let me summarize the first quarter's results.
As I said, we continue to see COVID-related disruption to printed books and in-person training in the quarter. Offsetting that was strong growth in key strategic areas, including Open Access publishing, research content usage, online student enrollment and digital courseware. The net result was that revenue rose 2%, adjusted EPS rose 124%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 42%. Organic revenue was down 1%.
I'll provide more detail on all of this in our segment discussions. The material earnings improvement this quarter was primarily driven by favorable revenue performance, particularly in Research, lower discretionary spending and savings from restructuring. Corporate expenses alone were down 16% or $7 million. Let's take a look at the segments.
Our research business continues to perform well. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA rose 6 and 19%, respectively. An important note is that about 4 million of our Q1 revenue came from journal subscription renewals that were delayed from Q4 due to COVID-19. That said, our strategies across the Research business continue to bear fruit.
Article output was up 13%. As you know, this is a key driver of our business models.  It's an outcome of good market growth, our strong publishing programs and our market-friendly publishing strategies. We continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth from our open access publishing program.
Our comprehensive national agreements in Europe are performing well with publishing volumes exceeding our expectations. Usage of the Wiley online library is growing strongly, up 10% over prior year. Our industry-leading society publishing program is having another great year. Net society wins will result in around $11 million of incremental publishing revenue in calendar '21.
In June, we signed a 10-year extension of our important Cochrane Library partnership. For reference, Cochrane is the world's preeminent collection of validated evidence for healthcare decision-makers. Our platform revenue rose 10% on new customer launches for Literatum. We continue to consolidate Literatum's industry-leading position in research content distribution, and our customer retention on a trailing 12-month basis was 98%.
Finally, we expanded our partnership with AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is one of the world's largest scientific societies. As part of this, we'll move the full suite of content from science, a globally celebrated family of journals, onto Literatum. This follows our recent announcement that we have also partnered with AAAS to grow their science career center.
I'll provide a bit of forward-looking color for each of our three segments. In research, our strong market position and diversified revenue streams are providing a solid foundation through this time of change. Calendar '20 subscription agreements are locked in through December of this year, and our calendar '21 renewal season just recently started. We do anticipate that COVID-related budget constraints at libraries will result in some price pressure for '21, but  It's too early to quantify.
In any case, we expect to offset this pressure through the continued strong growth of open access, research platforms and corporate solutions. At the same time, we continue to enhance our end-to-end workflows to improve efficiency and enhance the value proposition for researchers. We've made very good progress already, as evidenced in our strong EBITDA performance, reduced publishing cycle times and improved researcher engagement. In summary, we're seeing strong underlying indicators of future growth and long-term customer health.
In academic and professional learning, or APL, the story is an interesting one. The quarter was significantly affected by COVID due to the closure of bookstores, testing centers and corporate offices. Naturally, this affected the more traditional areas of APL, such as print book publishing, Test Prep services and in-person corporate training. The effect was that APL revenue declined 12, 13% organically, and adjusted EBITDA declined 23%.
But despite this short-term pressure, there's good news for the future in our KPIs. We're seeing quite positive trends in digital content and courseware as universities and companies pivot to virtual learning. We appear to be in an inflection point for digital content and digital courseware with record growth of 32 and 88%, respectively, on a pro forma basis. Our strategy to focus tightly on high-demand skills and careers is paying off.
In higher ed, we are gaining market share. Our share has grown from 4% in July 2018 to nearly 5% in July 2020 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our innovative zyBooks and Alta digital offerings are winning adoptions at an impressive pace. For example, zyBooks, our STEM platform, saw revenue double over the prior year, and it is winning consistently in large course adoptions.
So actually, I'm feeling good about the future of APL despite this quarter's COVID-19-related declines in our traditional business lines. For the remainder of the year, we expect that current trends will continue, namely that print book sales will continue to be challenged by COVID lockdowns and virtual learning. Note that print books represent a smaller portion of Wiley's overall business. Digital content and courseware will continue to grow strongly, helping to mitigate any potential decline this fall in higher ed enrollment.
Recovery in test prep will be dependent upon the reopening of testing sites and the resumption of certification exams. In corporate learning, we're seeing an acceleration of our virtual and hybrid corporate training products. We anticipate a strong post-pandemic recovery based upon what we are seeing in platform usage and new partner signings. Throughout APL, we're moving quickly to take advantage of the abrupt shift to digital learning by investing in our platforms and our go-to-market strategies.
This includes our value-driven business models that make content affordable. An example is our Inclusive Access program, which continues to grow very strongly. We are also responding to the moment by publishing timely titles on topics such as running businesses virtually and creating diverse, inclusive and equitable cultures. Finally, we're driving rapid and significant improvement in our cost structure to improve efficiency and our margin profile.
Our education services segment is positioned very well for this moment as universities, students and professionals are pivoting hard to both digital learning and online degrees. It will take time to fully realize the potential of this shift, but interest in our services, which help universities to succeed with online education, is running very high. For the quarter, revenue was up 29%, or 4% organically, and our EBITDA margin was 13%, which is up 9% for fiscal '20. Revenue growth was driven by $12 million of inorganic contribution from M3, as well as 9% growth in student enrollment.
Our mature and new programs are performing well, although organic growth was offset by small partner terminations as part of our continuous portfolio optimization. Our full-service partner count now stands at 67. We added two new full-service university partners in the quarter, the University of New Haven in Connecticut and Carlow University in Pennsylvania, and we signed additional universities for unbundled service agreements. Online program enrollment was very healthy this summer and remains so as we enter the fall semester.
At M3, we found the corporate demand for trained IT talent to be more stable in the pandemic than we had expected. Our existing customer base is solid, and we've begun placing new talent at several recently signed customers. Notably, we're gaining momentum in India where we are currently staffing a major new technology center for one of our global financial services clients. University services are facing significant pressures this year.
Universities are facing significant pressures this year as they simultaneously shift to hybrid and virtual learning while also dealing with financial shortfalls brought on by COVID-related enrollment declines. Although intermediate and long-term trends are very good, there is some near-term uncertainty to manage through with our clients. As with digital courseware, online education is now past the inflection point and is broadly adopted and accepted as a mainstream way to get a degree or certification. This was true before COVID, but the disruption of the past six months has driven home the value of high-quality, fairly priced education that can fit the life and career needs of the broad public.
This moment is reflected in enrollment trends and good pipeline of potential university partnerships, both in the U.S. and abroad and with our key partners, most of whom are evaluating online expansion opportunities. M3's IT talent placement volume is anticipated to be steady for the balance of the year as our corporate partners continue to maintain and grow their tech talent capacity. Major operational focus within education service is the continued improvement of the student journey from lead to enrollment.
These efforts continue to bear fruit in higher conversion rates and lower student acquisition costs. The business is well on track to realize its fiscal '22 goal of the 15% EBITDA margin. I'll now pass the call over to John to take you through our financial profile and optimization initiatives.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Brian. Despite a very challenging environment, we are generally pleased with our revenue and earnings performance for this quarter. That said, our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were unfavorable to prior year by $27 million and $20 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of changes in working capital. As a reminder, our cash flow is normally the use of cash in the first half of our fiscal year due to timing of collection for general subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
Capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, declined $6 million to $24 million for the quarter. As discussed on the last earnings call, we expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, with investment focused on new product and service capabilities, as well as process redesign and workflow automation. With respect to investment in acquisitions, we will remain opportunistic and continue our pursuit of attractive opportunities to add scale and provide enhanced tech-enabled products and services in both research and online education. In terms of our balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was up $117 million primarily due to acquisitions, but our interest expense was lower by $1.5 million as we realized the benefit of the lower interest rate environment.
Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.0 times, inclusive of all acquisitions. In terms of access to capital, we reported $101 million of cash on hand, and we ended the quarter with undrawn revolving credit of $650 million. Our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity afford us the flexibility to continue investing, acquiring and returning cash to shareholders. In June, the company modestly increased its quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.
Our current dividend yield is more than 4%. As a reminder, due to the economic downturn, we have refrained from repurchasing shares. We remain fully confident in our continued strategic momentum, cash generation and liquidity position, and we expect to resume share repurchases as the economic environment recovers. We are moving quickly on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the economic downturn and improve our agility and efficiency.
These programs are companywide and include optimizing our content development workflows, streamlining our customer support operations and achieving benchmark efficiency levels for corporate support functions, such as HR and finance. Meanwhile, we continue to maintain tight controls on discretionary spending across the company, and we have realized significant savings on travel, marketing events and professional fees. In addition, hiring and salary increases have been strictly limited to critical business needs and investment in our top performers. And in June, the executive leadership team and the board unanimously agreed to take six-month pay cuts ranging from 15% to 30%.
And as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a $15 million restructuring charge for actions that will generate annual run rate savings of approximately $30 million. Additional cost savings actions are anticipated in the current fiscal year. As an example, we are taking actions to rationalize our real estate portfolio given our successful transition to a virtual work environment. We will update you on our progress as the anticipated savings -- and the anticipated savings we will make throughout the year.
In summary, we are very well positioned to navigate the COVID-related challenges ahead while investing in key optimization and growth initiatives. As a reminder, given our limited visibility in the current economic environment, we have suspended our practice of providing annual guidance. We expect to return to providing guidance when the economic environment becomes more stable and our visibility improves. I'll now pass the call back to Brian.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. So, to recap the main messages for today, our business remains strong through the pandemic with good momentum continuing in both research and education services. We're experiencing COVID-related disruptions to print books and in-person training. Of course, this represents a smaller part of Wiley today, with nearly 80% of our revenue coming from digital products and tech-enabled services.
Core trends remain favorable in Wiley's key strategic areas of focus, such as peer-reviewed research, online education, digital content and courseware. We're taking full advantage of this unusual moment to drive improvement in the cost structure and core functioning of Wiley, focusing on high potential areas, such as our content development workflows, our management of the customer life cycle and the tuning of our real estate footprint for an increasingly virtual workforce. Overall, we're confident in the enduring importance of our Research and Education content, platforms and services. But more importantly, we're optimistic that this challenging moment -- at this challenging moment because we're seeing compelling evidence in our KPIs that our markets are strong and that our strategies are working.
To be specific, we're experiencing strong growth in demand to publish in our journals and consumer research, strong growth in Research platform signings, recurring revenue and content consumption with 98% client retention, strong growth in our digital courseware portfolio, strong growth in enrollment at our online degree programs and increased interest of universities in accelerating the transition to online education. So despite some near-term headwinds, the data tells me that we're tightly aligned with the current and long-term needs of our customers, the researchers, students, professors, administrators and corporate leaders that we serve worldwide. Once again, I want to thank our wonderful Wiley colleagues around the world for their grit, their positive spirit and their remarkable accomplishments this quarter. With that, I'll open the floor to your comments and questions.
Questions &amp; Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with research. Obviously, a really solid growth in a difficult environment.
How much of the jump in article output and content consumption would you contribute to COVID-related research? And as a follow-up, how much of the jump in research revenue and EBITDA reflects things like reprints and back files, open access? Just trying to get a sense for that relative to maybe the kind of legacy Research business, if you will.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start, and John can chip in. So, we're seeing -- definitely seeing good momentum in Research publishing. The COVID crisis has definitely increased the interest in -- or the output of researchers, and we see no signs of that declining.
With respect to specific COVID-related research, we certainly are publishing more COVID-related papers, as you would expect. But as a percentage of our total,  It's a very small percentage.  It's really a much broader --  It's a much broader increase in demand that we're seeing at this point in time that's coming across the portfolio. And to answer your second question, a large portion of that is coming in open access.
So, we're seeing really good growth rates in our open access pay-to-publish models, which, as you know, is a price times quantity model. So, when that happens, that translates directly into our revenue base. So we're definitely feeling consistent and increasing demand. And the practices that we've taken in the marketplace, which have been very market friendly, we believe, are leading researchers to choose Wiley and choose our journal.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Indeed. And on OA specifically, is it more article output from the same customers? More interest from new parties? How would you sort of weigh those two?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you know, in Open Access, the researchers themselves are deciding where to submit their articles. And as they do, they're choosing the titles, meaning the journal titles, and the publishers that they want to work with. So, increasingly,  It's almost a B2C model in that case. And so, things like the reputation, the quality of the customer experience, the researcher experience as they go through the publishing process, the speed with which the article gets out and the quality with which it gets promoted are what drives that.
So, we believe that we're seeing researchers choose us, quite simply stated. If that answers your question, Dan. If I didn't answer it specifically, please follow up.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
No, that helps. Absolutely. Maybe one or two quick follow-ups. The -- given the growth in OA, if we were to break down Research between kind of annual contracted revenue versus more variable or consumption-based, what would that look like at this stage percentage-wise?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, currently, as you look at our -- go ahead, John. Yes.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
I'll answer this in a way that is also responsive, Dan, to your question about what was the composition of revenue in the quarter. Roughly speaking, about 80% of our revenue comes from the combination of subscriptions and open access. And within that, call it, 70% of our research publishing business is subscription and about 10% of it is OA. The remaining 20% of our business, Dan, is, frankly, largely products and services that are derivatives of articles that are published under subscription, such as reprints that you mentioned and such as corporate advertising.
So, that's roughly the split of revenue that we have today. And of course, the subscription base is largely contracted, right? So that's well in play, but we're coming up on a renewal season. You asked whether -- you asked about are there significant backhaul revenues or such in the quarter, and the answer to that is no. This was a pretty normal quarter for us in terms of the composition of products and services that drove our revenue.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
That's helpful because that can be really high margin. One more, and I'll jump out. But you alluded, Brian, to obviously the extraordinary pressures that universities will be facing. Given where the stock is and has been trading, I think there's a lot more fear out there than -- well, may or may not warranted, we'll see.
But I know you don't want to get into the guidance, but when you think about Research, is there a range -- I guess, one, how are those initial dialogues going for calendar '21? And two, is there a range of revenue growth that you might be able to -- at an extreme high, extreme low bracket to sort of rein in some of the fears out there? Maybe  It's too early, but I thought I'd give you the opportunity.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah, look, I mean,  It's a completely fair question, and  It's what we want to know as well. We're talking to our customers very, very closely, and we're trying to get a sense of it. But  It's really early in the renewal season, and so it really is too early to tell.
We do expect some price pressure. But we expect that that price pressure should be offset by this strong growth that you're seeing in OA and in platforms and other areas. So, the simple answer is  It's too early to tell but that we believe that the price pressure we face will be modest and that it will be largely offset, if not more than offset, by our open access growth.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
OK. Helpful. I'll follow up with -- jump back in queue with any follow-up.

Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, Brian, historically, when GDP has fallen and unemployment has risen, enrollment trends have accelerated. And listening to your preamble, it doesn't sound like that's what you're seeing or anticipating for the fall semester, but just want to get more detail around that.
And then, on a related note, the 4% organic growth for Ed Services that you reported in the quarter, is that indicative of what we should anticipate for the balance of fiscal '21? And then, I have a follow-up.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Got it. So, from the perspective of the demand patterns in higher ed, this -- there's no question that there is a relationship between GDP, unemployment and college enrollment. That -- historically, that relationship has been one with a bit of a lag, a 12 to 18-month lag. And so, we do expect that to play out here, and we believe we're already seeing it in our leads, in our interest and in our enrollment.
But really, traditionally, that's played out over time. What's happening now in enrollment is different than that, though. What's happening now is literally a practical preclusion on universities from running schools as they normally had and a depression or a downward pressure on enrollment that's come from health fears related to being in large groups of people, as everybody knows. So, what we're seeing -- the enrollment pressure we're seeing is not some sort of an inverse relationship to the tradition.
In fact,  It's a novel pressure. And that novel pressure was expected in the fall to be in the neighborhood of 10 or 15%. We think it could be on the lower end of that. But from Wiley's perspective, and this is really important, from Wiley's perspective, our -- and that has -- that, by the way, will affect our principal sales.
But from Wiley's perspective, our strategic growth areas are digital courseware and online education, and those run counter to the trends that we're seeing in the market because if you can't go to school in person, you go online. Or if you're supposed to -- if you're usually in a classroom, but now you're going to be studying from home in a virtual environment, you have no choice but to get the digital materials. You can't share. You can't -- a book is not going to help because you need to be in the courseware.
So, that is contributing to an upswell in the parts of that business that we are strategically focused on in the future. So both in the services business, where we're focused on online enrollment, and in the courseware business or the content business, where we're focused on digital content and courseware, we actually believe that this is a material change that will have a long-term benefit for the business. Then answering second part of your question, we are seeing -- obviously, results are backward-looking. And in the spring, we definitely saw some shock to the system from COVID that affected enrollments.
It just -- this is not surprising. But over this summer, we started to see elevated levels of interest in our -- in lead generation and in conversion, leading to pretty good enrollment trend. So, our enrollment actually was up around 9% recently, and then we should see some of that continue. But again, we're just getting into the semester.
We'll just see exactly how this start goes. And so, we're not at all pessimistic. Quite the contrary, we're optimistic about where that business is going and the enrollment trends due to the things that I've been talking about, both the short-term shift to online translating into a greater acceptance of online learning and online education where it is really is the norm now in many cases for a large portion of people getting postsecondary educations, and then followed by what we expect to be a significant, economically driven increase in interest in education due to the inverse relationship that you identified before between the economy and enrollment in schools.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Got it. OK. Very helpful. And then, I know you spent a lot of time talking about open access, and it, obviously, had a very good quarter.
Just any updated thoughts around the sustainability of that growth? And then, separately, John, can you address the timing-related working capital issues that impacted your cash flow during the quarter?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll pick up the OA question first. We're -- long before COVID, we were seeing significantly greater volumes of submissions and consequent volumes of our output. That has continued and increase through COVID-19.
We see no reason to believe that  It's not going to continue. There might be a slight elevation now that's related to researchers being at home and finishing up papers. You think that would've been done already, and yet the elevated levels continue, and in fact, they're increasing. So, we're very bullish on those volumes levels continuing at a high level on a go-forward basis.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
And then, Drew, on your question with respect to cash flow and, in particular, the impact of working capital that I referenced in my comments, which were the biggest drivers. I mean, by the way, we had very strong performance in the quarter from a real earnings growth perspective, but then working capital played against us. And in particular, I would note that our cash collections associated with journals were pretty strong and in line with our expectations, so we're feeling good about collections there. We do have some customers that have requested extended terms, but  It's not a material impact to our results, and we feel like that's flowing well.
The most significant impact on the timing of working capital has to do with payables. In the March -- late March and April time frame, like others, we went into a bit of cash conservation mode given potential risks around liquidity in the market at that point in time. And so, we put some pressure on payables at that time. And then, as things began to ease up in our first quarter, we also eased up on payables.
So, the ground that we gave up on cash flow in the quarter is particularly concentrated around payables, and  It's just sort of the normal flow back to a balance after conserving cash at the end of the fourth quarter.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
OK. All right guys appreciate it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Sami Kassab with Exane.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my questions, I have three of them, please. The first one is on a topic that I think you've just touched on, but I would kindly like you to perhaps elaborate a little bit more.
On open access, what's the risk that the elevated levels of submissions that we've seen actually reflect the fact that scientists have been locked down at home and away from their labs and had a lot of time to write papers but had no ability to make progress on their scientific research and that those three, four months will actually, six months, 12 months down the road, will lead to a slowdown in open access growth as science did not really happen through the lockdowns? Secondly, on China, we've seen the Chinese government communicate new research appraisal policies, pushing Chinese scientists to publish more into Chinese local language journals, [Inaudible] moving away from splicing. Do you think the China policy and regulatory changes may have an impact, or is that too small to matter? Is that not something that is big on your radar screen? Then lastly, can you elaborate a little bit on how you see the regulatory environment in OPM? We've had the likes of Bob Sherman and Senator Warren look at OPM. Do you think the regulatory environment could be at risk of changing? Or do you think  It's a solid regime that you have today and you have no major concerns on the regulatory front for OPM?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you very much for asking three questions, each of which is a dissertation. So, I'll take them one at a time. They're very good questions, excellent questions that I'd be asking if I were you. So the first one, on the risk of the elevated level of OA sort of bringing back to some lower level later, we are now six or more months into this pandemic; seven or eight, depending on where you're looking in the world.
We continue to see elevated levels. We continue to see researchers putting out papers. Researchers are going back into the labs, absolutely. And so, we're -- we expect it to continue at some level.
Could it come back a little bit? Of course, it could. We're at a very high level right now. But I will remind you that trends in research are very, very positive in terms of overall increasing volume of output in the marketplace. So, in other words, we see mid to high-single-digit increases in the volume of papers every year.
And that long preceded the environment. We consider that will continue in the future. The second thing is that the research continues to be something that is funded at a very high level. In countries around the world, we see no we see no signs of that declining.
So, yeah, I mean, there's no question that there could be a little bit of an artificial increase, but those artificial -- those increases have continued for quite some time now. The final thing I'd say on that is we believe that our publishing program and our approach to publishing is extremely researcher and market friendly, and we think we're getting more than our fair share of submissions. I'll also remind you that of all the submissions we get, we publish a very small portion of them, and so there's always increasing potential there. So, no, I don't see a snapback or a rebound that goes the wrong way on us in the future.
Now, the question of China, another really good question. China is a super important market in the future of research. China is a very important producer and consumer of research. China represents around 5% of our research publishing business now.
So, from a business perspective,  It's not going to swing us one way or the other in any given quarter, but it is very important in the long run, and we are -- and the increasing discussion in China about their endemic -- or indigenous publishing is certainly an important move and important trend. But we have very, very close relationships in China. We have a very good connection to the government agencies and so forth there, and we continue to stay very close to them. Chinese researchers want their journals to be in the best journals in the world so that they can get the recognition and the -- for their work that they desire, and we believe our publishing portfolio leads us there.
But also, we are increasingly partnering in China to make sure that we are seen as the publisher of choice. So, while there is some -- there's always some concern when there are discussions going on in places like China about changes in policy, we believe that, ultimately, we're very well positioned to capitalize on what is still continuing significant growth in both Chinese publishing and Chinese consumption.

Sorry, may I squeeze in a follow-up before we move to OPM? In subscription unbundling and sub has seen some strong takeup, a third of R1 universities on unsub within less than a year. Do you see a trend or risk toward more unbundling of the big deals, especially in the U.S. as universities face budgetary pressure?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So, if the question is about unbundling and whether we are seeing more or we'll be seeing more, as universities face pressure, they certainly are looking for ways to save cost. I've said we can't really comment on what we expect that pricing pressure to be. But as we look into the market, we don't see a lot of evidence.
We see some one-off cases, but we don't see a lot of evidence of universities and university librarians saying we don't need that content, our researchers don't need it, we're not using it. So, to the extent that we have a high -- which we do, a very high-quality portfolio of journals that is essential to the success of research, we will continue to be purchased by those universities. I'll remind you that academics make their careers based upon research, and universities climb the rankings or to descend in the rankings based upon their positioning in the research ecosystem and both the volume and the quality of their output. So, research and research content is absolutely central to the success of our important clients.
So, while we may see some edge cases because, to be sure, there's pressure in the marketplace, we don't see any sort of any evidence of a large-scale trend toward unbundling. OK. And let me move toward OPM. So, the conversation about OPM has gone on for a long time, and the conversation about the revenue share model has gone on for a long period of time.
We start from the position that we have excellent relationships, long-term relationships with our universities, and we help those universities fundamentally to succeed. We help them to succeed by providing extremely high-quality programs, by attracting students and by matriculating those students at extremely high completion rates, higher completion rates than typically they see in their on-ground programs. So, insofar as we are doing that, we are helping those universities to succeed. There has long been a conversation about the revenue share model.
Our clients seem to be fine with it. Now, to be sure, there will be some movement in the marketplace there, and therefore, Wiley has adopted again, as we always do, very market friendly practices of working with universities on terms that they believe are fair. And we have our bundled revenue share model businesses, we have our fee-for-service businesses and so forth. So, we believe wherever the market goes, we're going to be fine.
Having said that, we participate very closely in the discussions that go on in Washington and elsewhere on the future of education, generally speaking, and on the future of of higher ed and its relationship with service providers. So, we've responded to the various inquiries. They have been ongoing. We expect them to continue to be ongoing.
But we're very close to it, and we are not -- our confidence in the future is based upon the fact that we're in a consensual relationship, if you call it, with our partners, who are getting a tremendous amount out of it. If we, together, or if they decide they want to go in a different direction, we're very happy to go in a different direction with them, and we always have been. So we don't view it as a major threat.  It's something to be talked about,  It's something to be studied,  It's something to be adapted to.
But we are confident in our position and, more importantly, the position and the quality of the services and the value of the services that we provide to the marketplace.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
This is fantastic and all very convincing. You said in your opening remarks that you had higher completion rates. Did you mean that your OPM program has higher completion rate than equivalent on-campus programs have?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Typically speaking, our programs -- I will say, our programs have very high completion rates for the students that start and those that complete the program. I'll remind you that, historically, when the industry has come under pressure, it has been for universities and education providers that have had extremely low completion rates, such that students started but they never finished and, therefore, never got value for the education that they paid for or that somebody else, such as the government or the taxpayer, paid for. That is absolutely not the case in our programs. The completion rates are extremely high, and our clients are happy with them.
And, clearly, students are happy with them because they're staying through to completion and achieving career outcomes that perpetuate the demand for the product.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen. Prior to COVID, rearing its ugly head, margins were eroding. Was that from your conversion from hard copy to digital, or did it relate to state cutbacks in education?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
John, do you want to pick that up?
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, just generally, looking back over fiscal year '20, we did see some erosion of our margin. I would say that the most significant drivers behind that erosion of margin were two. One was the rapid -- continued rapid decline of print, which has reasonably good margins.
But print, as we know, is in decline, and that rate of decline got a bit faster in the past fiscal year and had an impact on our bottom line. We're taking actions, as we discussed in today's review, to improve the profitability of that business by focusing and by, in particular, focusing our future on digital courseware and digital content. The second factor that contributed overall to the shift in the blended margin of the business, there's an increased component of our revenue coming from OPM business that we just talked about. And we recognize that in its current state, the market itself in its current state that operating margins are low.
But we've been emphasizing that we are balancing between top line growth, which is very important to us, and improving profitability there. And we said that we would drive that business to 15% EBITDA margin by next year, and we're well on the march to get there. But those are the two factors that have been putting pressure on our margin, and both of them are being addressed.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
If going forward, there are continued high levels of unemployment, is that a tailwind in that there's a tendency for enrollments in school to go up in that kind of macroeconomic environment?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I'll pick that back up, John. As I was indicating earlier, there is a long term -- and in fact, I think it was either Dan or Drew that pointed it out, there is a long-term established pattern of when the economy goes down and unemployment goes up, that people go back to school. That relationship is typically a lagged relationship, meaning it happens not instantly, it happens 12 to 18 months later, and we do expect to see that.
But we have other tailwinds that are hitting us right now, which is simply that people can't go to school in person. They're physically precluded from going to school fully in person. And so, therefore, we have elevated levels of interest from potential students in taking education in an online world. It also is providing a tailwind, as I indicated earlier, to our digital courseware businesses, which, as I indicated in my remarks, are seeing record increases in usage and adoption because again, if you're not in a physical setting, you need a learning management system based product, something that -- where your teacher can make assignments, where you can do homework, where you can get the content predictably, the content that the teacher needs, not have to Google for your curriculum.
And physical books just aren't as good in those environments. They don't do all those things. And so, there's a significant tailwind that hits you in that sense. And, again, as I indicated, the -- we believe that these are accelerations of long-term trends so that it won't be a short-term blip.
We believe that we're going to see continued elevation of those levels, which is completely -- all of these trends that I'm talking about are completely in sync and aligned with our strategy that we've been working on for the last few years. And  It's gratifying to see it start to come to fruition at a time when the world needs both education and research more than ever.

All earnings call transcripts",,
463,matt@logrocket.com,"Matthew!?!LogRocket!?!In an unprecedented year that saw many teams shift to remote working, we asked tech and business leaders to pick their essential tools.
Throughout our Leaders Insights series on Siliconrepublic.com last year, we asked a host of tech and business leaders from Ireland and further afield to name the essential tools and resources that get them through the working week.
In a year that brought major disruption to most of our working lives, they turned to video conferencing, collaboration software and a whole lot of coffee.
Handy hardware
The move away from offices means many of us are now relying on tech devices for both work and keeping in touch. Seán Keating of Vilicom said his number-one tool is his smartphone. Its like the Swiss army knife of business tools. It keeps me on schedule, navigates to meetings, runs all our most important business apps, connects my laptop to our IT cloud, enables our Teams communications and more.
HPs Gary Tierney said that his phone and laptop are the must-have items for work, but since the arrival of Covid-19 he has been relying more on his laptop. Ive found that working from home has put an even greater emphasis on the criticality of my PC as a communication tool and a general workhorse.
Many people also had to figure out a new at-home work set-up last year. I recently invested in a 38-inch ultra-wide monitor and its been a game changer for me, Joe Lennon of Workvivo told us over the summer.
Video conferencing
2020 was the year we all became very familiar with Zoom (as well as Zoombombing and Zoom fatigue).
Amy Bunszel of Autodesk said she now spends most of her day on Zoom, and Patrick Horgan of Horizon8 said tools such as Zoom are proving incredibly helpful in the work-from-home dynamic.
But there are plenty of other alternatives out there. Microsoft Teams was highlighted as an essential daily tool by plenty of people, including SL Controls Keith Moran, CWSIs Ronan Murphy and Avanades Graham Healy.
Martin McKay of Texthelp said he couldnt be without the Google Meet and Chat tools at the moment, and Xilinxs Brendan Farley said Skype and Webex are other options being used for video calls.
Online collaboration tools are integral to not just our success but our basic functioning, added Ogie Sheehy of ViClarity. Whether it is Zoom or GoToMeeting, Google Chat or Microsoft Teams, these tools are enabling us to continue to work uninterrupted across a global footprint. 
Software saviours
While Microsoft Teams has seen a sharp rise in users in the past year, many companies have been relying on other products from the Microsoft 365 stack. Ronan Murphy of CWSI said these tools allow his company to do whatever we need to do from wherever we are.
SoftwareOnes Una Keeshan said she uses the focus plan in Microsoft MyAnalytics to set aside time for priority work, while Avanades Graham Healy said he uses Microsoft Dynamics for customer relationship management and Power BI for reporting, forecasting and analytics.
With teams dispersed, messaging and collaboration tools such as Slack also came to the fore. Its a convenient way to collaborate over projects and to organise ourselves according to different topics and business functions, said Oz Alashe of CybSafe.
Collaboration tools have always been important for developers. Joe Lennon of Workvivo said GitHub is fundamental for his engineering team to manage source code and code reviews, and they regularly use Tuple to do remote pair programming.
Jennifer Sethre of Intry said Intercom and LogRocket are important tools for her HR tech company, and Keith Moran of SL Controls turns to the Frankli platform for engaging with his team.
Lettertecs Frank Kelly uses Google Keep for jotting quick notes down as they occur, while ViClaritys Ogie Sheehy is a fan of the voice dictation app on his iPhone. It allows me to be immediately responsive to important emails that come through when I am out and about and away from my desk, he said.
A good old-fashioned to-do list
While there may be a fancy tech tool for everything, many leaders still rely on a simple to-do list to keep focused. Nessa McEniff of Learnovate said listing her priorities is a key part of the week and shes a bit of an obsessive list maker.
Netssos Brian ODoherty added that a having a clear list keeps him grounded. I set myself a weekly list and find that its a great way of keeping the faith in myself, my work and my ambitions, he said.
But Liz Cunningham of Google said she is still looking for the perfect tool that will manage all her to-do lists across personal and work life to help keep all the balls in the air.
PayPals Annette Hickey noted that her calendar helps keep her focused throughout the week, and Dells Jason Ward said an organised calendar is key to ensuring I am as productive as possible.
Keeping the mind clear
The sudden shift to remote working means that many have had to find new ways to focus, while still maintaining a good work-life balance and not overworking now that your kitchen may be your office.
To help with this, Nicole Sahin of Globalization Partners said she keeps Fridays free of Zoom meetings. Its like heaven to have that time to think and get things done.
Similarly, Codemas Donna Gartland said that, since the shift to working from home, she now blocks time in her calendar each week without meetings to focus and get deep work done. I use distraction blockers across all my devices, she added, such as Stay Focusd on my browser and Focus mode on Pixel.
Xilinxs Brendan Farley said he removed the work email app from his phone many years ago, which helps him switch off in the evenings. And Mark Cockerill of ServiceNow suggested having a great Spotify playlist on hand.
Getting away from the desk
For minding mental and physical health, many other leaders also suggested getting out and about. SL Controls Keith Moran enjoys a good game of squash in the evening, Arkphires Paul Nannetti tries to run on the beach a few times a week, and Fenergos Louise OConnell said that yoga or a walk in the fresh air can help to just clear the mind.
Una Keeshan of SoftwareOne has recently taken tennis back up as a hobby. The tennis is not only great exercise, she said, but also helps me clear my head from work or the stresses of the day.
And Autodesks Amy Bunszel said that, now she doesnt have a commute for the time being, its a bit easier to make time for exercise every morning and a nice dinner in the evening.
Food certainly plays a key part in the day for many. Horizon8s Patrick Horgan said the barbecue has proved an essential tool for bringing his family together in the current environment.
And one of the essential tools to get Dells Jason Ward through the week? Coffee, coffee and more coffee.",,

Throughout our Leaders Insights series on Siliconrepublic.com last year, we asked a host of tech and business leaders from Ireland and further afield to name the essential tools and resources that get them through the working week.
In a year that brought major disruption to most of our working lives, they turned to video conferencing, collaboration software and a whole lot of coffee.
Handy hardware
The move away from offices means many of us are now relying on tech devices for both work and keeping in touch. Seán Keating of Vilicom said his number-one tool is his smartphone. Its like the Swiss army knife of business tools. It keeps me on schedule, navigates to meetings, runs all our most important business apps, connects my laptop to our IT cloud, enables our Teams communications and more.
HPs Gary Tierney said that his phone and laptop are the must-have items for work, but since the arrival of Covid-19 he has been relying more on his laptop. Ive found that working from home has put an even greater emphasis on the criticality of my PC as a communication tool and a general workhorse.
Many people also had to figure out a new at-home work set-up last year. I recently invested in a 38-inch ultra-wide monitor and its been a game changer for me, Joe Lennon of Workvivo told us over the summer.
Video conferencing
2020 was the year we all became very familiar with Zoom (as well as Zoombombing and Zoom fatigue).
Amy Bunszel of Autodesk said she now spends most of her day on Zoom, and Patrick Horgan of Horizon8 said tools such as Zoom are proving incredibly helpful in the work-from-home dynamic.
But there are plenty of other alternatives out there. Microsoft Teams was highlighted as an essential daily tool by plenty of people, including SL Controls Keith Moran, CWSIs Ronan Murphy and Avanades Graham Healy.
Martin McKay of Texthelp said he couldnt be without the Google Meet and Chat tools at the moment, and Xilinxs Brendan Farley said Skype and Webex are other options being used for video calls.
Online collaboration tools are integral to not just our success but our basic functioning, added Ogie Sheehy of ViClarity. Whether it is Zoom or GoToMeeting, Google Chat or Microsoft Teams, these tools are enabling us to continue to work uninterrupted across a global footprint. 
Software saviours
While Microsoft Teams has seen a sharp rise in users in the past year, many companies have been relying on other products from the Microsoft 365 stack. Ronan Murphy of CWSI said these tools allow his company to do whatever we need to do from wherever we are.
SoftwareOnes Una Keeshan said she uses the focus plan in Microsoft MyAnalytics to set aside time for priority work, while Avanades Graham Healy said he uses Microsoft Dynamics for customer relationship management and Power BI for reporting, forecasting and analytics.
With teams dispersed, messaging and collaboration tools such as Slack also came to the fore. Its a convenient way to collaborate over projects and to organise ourselves according to different topics and business functions, said Oz Alashe of CybSafe.
Collaboration tools have always been important for developers. Joe Lennon of Workvivo said GitHub is fundamental for his engineering team to manage source code and code reviews, and they regularly use Tuple to do remote pair programming.
Jennifer Sethre of Intry said Intercom and LogRocket are important tools for her HR tech company, and Keith Moran of SL Controls turns to the Frankli platform for engaging with his team.
Lettertecs Frank Kelly uses Google Keep for jotting quick notes down as they occur, while ViClaritys Ogie Sheehy is a fan of the voice dictation app on his iPhone. It allows me to be immediately responsive to important emails that come through when I am out and about and away from my desk, he said.
A good old-fashioned to-do list
While there may be a fancy tech tool for everything, many leaders still rely on a simple to-do list to keep focused. Nessa McEniff of Learnovate said listing her priorities is a key part of the week and shes a bit of an obsessive list maker.
Netssos Brian ODoherty added that a having a clear list keeps him grounded. I set myself a weekly list and find that its a great way of keeping the faith in myself, my work and my ambitions, he said.
But Liz Cunningham of Google said she is still looking for the perfect tool that will manage all her to-do lists across personal and work life to help keep all the balls in the air.
PayPals Annette Hickey noted that her calendar helps keep her focused throughout the week, and Dells Jason Ward said an organised calendar is key to ensuring I am as productive as possible.
Keeping the mind clear
The sudden shift to remote working means that many have had to find new ways to focus, while still maintaining a good work-life balance and not overworking now that your kitchen may be your office.
To help with this, Nicole Sahin of Globalization Partners said she keeps Fridays free of Zoom meetings. Its like heaven to have that time to think and get things done.
Similarly, Codemas Donna Gartland said that, since the shift to working from home, she now blocks time in her calendar each week without meetings to focus and get deep work done. I use distraction blockers across all my devices, she added, such as Stay Focusd on my browser and Focus mode on Pixel.
Xilinxs Brendan Farley said he removed the work email app from his phone many years ago, which helps him switch off in the evenings. And Mark Cockerill of ServiceNow suggested having a great Spotify playlist on hand.
Getting away from the desk
For minding mental and physical health, many other leaders also suggested getting out and about. SL Controls Keith Moran enjoys a good game of squash in the evening, Arkphires Paul Nannetti tries to run on the beach a few times a week, and Fenergos Louise OConnell said that yoga or a walk in the fresh air can help to just clear the mind.
Una Keeshan of SoftwareOne has recently taken tennis back up as a hobby. The tennis is not only great exercise, she said, but also helps me clear my head from work or the stresses of the day.
And Autodesks Amy Bunszel said that, now she doesnt have a commute for the time being, its a bit easier to make time for exercise every morning and a nice dinner in the evening.
Food certainly plays a key part in the day for many. Horizon8s Patrick Horgan said the barbecue has proved an essential tool for bringing his family together in the current environment.
And one of the essential tools to get Dells Jason Ward through the week? Coffee, coffee and more coffee.",,

John Wiley &amp; Sons (A Shares) (NYSE:JW-A)Q1 2021 Earnings CallSep 03, 2020, 10:00 a.m. ET
Contents:
<ul><li>Prepared Remarks</li><li>Questions and Answers</li><li>Call Participants</li></ul>Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Wiley's vice president of investor relations, Brian Campbell. Please go ahead.
Brian Campbell -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter 2021 earnings update. On the call with me are Brian Napack, president and chief executive officer; and John Kritzmacher, chief financial officer. A few reminders to start.
The call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. You shouldn't rely on these statements, as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our SEC filings. The company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Wiley provides non-GAAP measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends.
These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under GAAP. Please see the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures presented in the supplementary information included in our press release. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency, unless otherwise specified.
After the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. I'll now turn the call over to Wiley's president and CEO, Brian Napack. 
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Right now, educators and students around the world are heading back to school and researchers are heading back into their labs in a world significantly altered by COVID-19. As they do, they're rewriting the playbooks for education and research. From our vantage point,  It's clear that they're turning to digital content, platforms and services at unprecedented levels, and they're also turning to corporate partners, such as Wiley, who can help them achieve their goals in a changed world.
The result for Wiley is that across the company, demand for our digital products and services has grown markedly. This unusual moment is moving our markets and proving that the strategies that we have been pursuing are not only right for the market today, they are right for where the market is going in the long term. We had a solid first quarter of revenue and earnings performance despite the disrupted environment. This demonstrated both resilience of our business and tight alignment of our strategies with the market's evolving needs.
We'll talk specifics about our performance shortly, but  It's important to note that today's acute health, economic and social problems serve to reinforce the value of Wiley's mission. Over the past months, we've moved faster to validate and publish more research and have made thousands of critical COVID-related research studies freely available. We've helped many universities, schools and corporations around the world to more quickly migrate from traditional to virtual learning. And we spent lots of time in our communities, raised money for causes that address injustice and taking concrete actions to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion within Wiley.
We continue to be reminded of the racial inequality plaguing our society and the need for corporate citizens, such as us, to play an active role in dismantling it. Our global team takes great pride in the fact that their work is truly helping the world to heal, recover, and thrive. Wiley today remains largely in work-from-home mode, although we have partially opened a few offices around the world where local health conditions allow. I want to recognize the great work of our team in executing at a very high level through this challenging period.
Simply stated, the team continues to deliver on our key milestones and customer commitments. In regular surveys, the vast majority of our colleagues report feeling productive and happy, and their engagement is very high. This can be attributed to our strong mission-driven culture, our tech-enabled workflows and our consistent emphasis on colleague care. The pandemic continues to disrupt the global economy, and this has directly impacted some of our more traditional revenue sources, such as physical books and in person training.
But despite these focused headwinds, we're very encouraged by the underlying momentum we're seeing in education and research. This momentum should continue well beyond the pandemic. We've been talking for some time about the positive trends that are driving research and education. Our growth strategy is built on these trends.
I'm pleased to see that they are accelerating at this moment and that Wiley is capitalizing on them. Research output is rising rapidly. Demand for online education and for the digital courseware to support it is also rising rapidly. The acceleration in these areas speaks well to our long-term outlook.
Internally, we are using the moment to lean into our operational excellence. This includes a focus on improving content workflows, our customer journeys our facilities' footprint and more. John will talk about this later, but there is much we have done and much that we continue to do to improve the efficiency of operations. With that, let me summarize the first quarter's results.
As I said, we continue to see COVID-related disruption to printed books and in-person training in the quarter. Offsetting that was strong growth in key strategic areas, including Open Access publishing, research content usage, online student enrollment and digital courseware. The net result was that revenue rose 2%, adjusted EPS rose 124%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 42%. Organic revenue was down 1%.
I'll provide more detail on all of this in our segment discussions. The material earnings improvement this quarter was primarily driven by favorable revenue performance, particularly in Research, lower discretionary spending and savings from restructuring. Corporate expenses alone were down 16% or $7 million. Let's take a look at the segments.
Our research business continues to perform well. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA rose 6 and 19%, respectively. An important note is that about 4 million of our Q1 revenue came from journal subscription renewals that were delayed from Q4 due to COVID-19. That said, our strategies across the Research business continue to bear fruit.
Article output was up 13%. As you know, this is a key driver of our business models.  It's an outcome of good market growth, our strong publishing programs and our market-friendly publishing strategies. We continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth from our open access publishing program.
Our comprehensive national agreements in Europe are performing well with publishing volumes exceeding our expectations. Usage of the Wiley online library is growing strongly, up 10% over prior year. Our industry-leading society publishing program is having another great year. Net society wins will result in around $11 million of incremental publishing revenue in calendar '21.
In June, we signed a 10-year extension of our important Cochrane Library partnership. For reference, Cochrane is the world's preeminent collection of validated evidence for healthcare decision-makers. Our platform revenue rose 10% on new customer launches for Literatum. We continue to consolidate Literatum's industry-leading position in research content distribution, and our customer retention on a trailing 12-month basis was 98%.
Finally, we expanded our partnership with AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is one of the world's largest scientific societies. As part of this, we'll move the full suite of content from science, a globally celebrated family of journals, onto Literatum. This follows our recent announcement that we have also partnered with AAAS to grow their science career center.
I'll provide a bit of forward-looking color for each of our three segments. In research, our strong market position and diversified revenue streams are providing a solid foundation through this time of change. Calendar '20 subscription agreements are locked in through December of this year, and our calendar '21 renewal season just recently started. We do anticipate that COVID-related budget constraints at libraries will result in some price pressure for '21, but  It's too early to quantify.
In any case, we expect to offset this pressure through the continued strong growth of open access, research platforms and corporate solutions. At the same time, we continue to enhance our end-to-end workflows to improve efficiency and enhance the value proposition for researchers. We've made very good progress already, as evidenced in our strong EBITDA performance, reduced publishing cycle times and improved researcher engagement. In summary, we're seeing strong underlying indicators of future growth and long-term customer health.
In academic and professional learning, or APL, the story is an interesting one. The quarter was significantly affected by COVID due to the closure of bookstores, testing centers and corporate offices. Naturally, this affected the more traditional areas of APL, such as print book publishing, Test Prep services and in-person corporate training. The effect was that APL revenue declined 12, 13% organically, and adjusted EBITDA declined 23%.
But despite this short-term pressure, there's good news for the future in our KPIs. We're seeing quite positive trends in digital content and courseware as universities and companies pivot to virtual learning. We appear to be in an inflection point for digital content and digital courseware with record growth of 32 and 88%, respectively, on a pro forma basis. Our strategy to focus tightly on high-demand skills and careers is paying off.
In higher ed, we are gaining market share. Our share has grown from 4% in July 2018 to nearly 5% in July 2020 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our innovative zyBooks and Alta digital offerings are winning adoptions at an impressive pace. For example, zyBooks, our STEM platform, saw revenue double over the prior year, and it is winning consistently in large course adoptions.
So actually, I'm feeling good about the future of APL despite this quarter's COVID-19-related declines in our traditional business lines. For the remainder of the year, we expect that current trends will continue, namely that print book sales will continue to be challenged by COVID lockdowns and virtual learning. Note that print books represent a smaller portion of Wiley's overall business. Digital content and courseware will continue to grow strongly, helping to mitigate any potential decline this fall in higher ed enrollment.
Recovery in test prep will be dependent upon the reopening of testing sites and the resumption of certification exams. In corporate learning, we're seeing an acceleration of our virtual and hybrid corporate training products. We anticipate a strong post-pandemic recovery based upon what we are seeing in platform usage and new partner signings. Throughout APL, we're moving quickly to take advantage of the abrupt shift to digital learning by investing in our platforms and our go-to-market strategies.
This includes our value-driven business models that make content affordable. An example is our Inclusive Access program, which continues to grow very strongly. We are also responding to the moment by publishing timely titles on topics such as running businesses virtually and creating diverse, inclusive and equitable cultures. Finally, we're driving rapid and significant improvement in our cost structure to improve efficiency and our margin profile.
Our education services segment is positioned very well for this moment as universities, students and professionals are pivoting hard to both digital learning and online degrees. It will take time to fully realize the potential of this shift, but interest in our services, which help universities to succeed with online education, is running very high. For the quarter, revenue was up 29%, or 4% organically, and our EBITDA margin was 13%, which is up 9% for fiscal '20. Revenue growth was driven by $12 million of inorganic contribution from M3, as well as 9% growth in student enrollment.
Our mature and new programs are performing well, although organic growth was offset by small partner terminations as part of our continuous portfolio optimization. Our full-service partner count now stands at 67. We added two new full-service university partners in the quarter, the University of New Haven in Connecticut and Carlow University in Pennsylvania, and we signed additional universities for unbundled service agreements. Online program enrollment was very healthy this summer and remains so as we enter the fall semester.
At M3, we found the corporate demand for trained IT talent to be more stable in the pandemic than we had expected. Our existing customer base is solid, and we've begun placing new talent at several recently signed customers. Notably, we're gaining momentum in India where we are currently staffing a major new technology center for one of our global financial services clients. University services are facing significant pressures this year.
Universities are facing significant pressures this year as they simultaneously shift to hybrid and virtual learning while also dealing with financial shortfalls brought on by COVID-related enrollment declines. Although intermediate and long-term trends are very good, there is some near-term uncertainty to manage through with our clients. As with digital courseware, online education is now past the inflection point and is broadly adopted and accepted as a mainstream way to get a degree or certification. This was true before COVID, but the disruption of the past six months has driven home the value of high-quality, fairly priced education that can fit the life and career needs of the broad public.
This moment is reflected in enrollment trends and good pipeline of potential university partnerships, both in the U.S. and abroad and with our key partners, most of whom are evaluating online expansion opportunities. M3's IT talent placement volume is anticipated to be steady for the balance of the year as our corporate partners continue to maintain and grow their tech talent capacity. Major operational focus within education service is the continued improvement of the student journey from lead to enrollment.
These efforts continue to bear fruit in higher conversion rates and lower student acquisition costs. The business is well on track to realize its fiscal '22 goal of the 15% EBITDA margin. I'll now pass the call over to John to take you through our financial profile and optimization initiatives.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Brian. Despite a very challenging environment, we are generally pleased with our revenue and earnings performance for this quarter. That said, our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were unfavorable to prior year by $27 million and $20 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of changes in working capital. As a reminder, our cash flow is normally the use of cash in the first half of our fiscal year due to timing of collection for general subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
Capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, declined $6 million to $24 million for the quarter. As discussed on the last earnings call, we expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, with investment focused on new product and service capabilities, as well as process redesign and workflow automation. With respect to investment in acquisitions, we will remain opportunistic and continue our pursuit of attractive opportunities to add scale and provide enhanced tech-enabled products and services in both research and online education. In terms of our balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was up $117 million primarily due to acquisitions, but our interest expense was lower by $1.5 million as we realized the benefit of the lower interest rate environment.
Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.0 times, inclusive of all acquisitions. In terms of access to capital, we reported $101 million of cash on hand, and we ended the quarter with undrawn revolving credit of $650 million. Our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity afford us the flexibility to continue investing, acquiring and returning cash to shareholders. In June, the company modestly increased its quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.
Our current dividend yield is more than 4%. As a reminder, due to the economic downturn, we have refrained from repurchasing shares. We remain fully confident in our continued strategic momentum, cash generation and liquidity position, and we expect to resume share repurchases as the economic environment recovers. We are moving quickly on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the economic downturn and improve our agility and efficiency.
These programs are companywide and include optimizing our content development workflows, streamlining our customer support operations and achieving benchmark efficiency levels for corporate support functions, such as HR and finance. Meanwhile, we continue to maintain tight controls on discretionary spending across the company, and we have realized significant savings on travel, marketing events and professional fees. In addition, hiring and salary increases have been strictly limited to critical business needs and investment in our top performers. And in June, the executive leadership team and the board unanimously agreed to take six-month pay cuts ranging from 15% to 30%.
And as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a $15 million restructuring charge for actions that will generate annual run rate savings of approximately $30 million. Additional cost savings actions are anticipated in the current fiscal year. As an example, we are taking actions to rationalize our real estate portfolio given our successful transition to a virtual work environment. We will update you on our progress as the anticipated savings -- and the anticipated savings we will make throughout the year.
In summary, we are very well positioned to navigate the COVID-related challenges ahead while investing in key optimization and growth initiatives. As a reminder, given our limited visibility in the current economic environment, we have suspended our practice of providing annual guidance. We expect to return to providing guidance when the economic environment becomes more stable and our visibility improves. I'll now pass the call back to Brian.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. So, to recap the main messages for today, our business remains strong through the pandemic with good momentum continuing in both research and education services. We're experiencing COVID-related disruptions to print books and in-person training. Of course, this represents a smaller part of Wiley today, with nearly 80% of our revenue coming from digital products and tech-enabled services.
Core trends remain favorable in Wiley's key strategic areas of focus, such as peer-reviewed research, online education, digital content and courseware. We're taking full advantage of this unusual moment to drive improvement in the cost structure and core functioning of Wiley, focusing on high potential areas, such as our content development workflows, our management of the customer life cycle and the tuning of our real estate footprint for an increasingly virtual workforce. Overall, we're confident in the enduring importance of our Research and Education content, platforms and services. But more importantly, we're optimistic that this challenging moment -- at this challenging moment because we're seeing compelling evidence in our KPIs that our markets are strong and that our strategies are working.
To be specific, we're experiencing strong growth in demand to publish in our journals and consumer research, strong growth in Research platform signings, recurring revenue and content consumption with 98% client retention, strong growth in our digital courseware portfolio, strong growth in enrollment at our online degree programs and increased interest of universities in accelerating the transition to online education. So despite some near-term headwinds, the data tells me that we're tightly aligned with the current and long-term needs of our customers, the researchers, students, professors, administrators and corporate leaders that we serve worldwide. Once again, I want to thank our wonderful Wiley colleagues around the world for their grit, their positive spirit and their remarkable accomplishments this quarter. With that, I'll open the floor to your comments and questions.
Questions &amp; Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with research. Obviously, a really solid growth in a difficult environment.
How much of the jump in article output and content consumption would you contribute to COVID-related research? And as a follow-up, how much of the jump in research revenue and EBITDA reflects things like reprints and back files, open access? Just trying to get a sense for that relative to maybe the kind of legacy Research business, if you will.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start, and John can chip in. So, we're seeing -- definitely seeing good momentum in Research publishing. The COVID crisis has definitely increased the interest in -- or the output of researchers, and we see no signs of that declining.
With respect to specific COVID-related research, we certainly are publishing more COVID-related papers, as you would expect. But as a percentage of our total,  It's a very small percentage.  It's really a much broader --  It's a much broader increase in demand that we're seeing at this point in time that's coming across the portfolio. And to answer your second question, a large portion of that is coming in open access.
So, we're seeing really good growth rates in our open access pay-to-publish models, which, as you know, is a price times quantity model. So, when that happens, that translates directly into our revenue base. So we're definitely feeling consistent and increasing demand. And the practices that we've taken in the marketplace, which have been very market friendly, we believe, are leading researchers to choose Wiley and choose our journal.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Indeed. And on OA specifically, is it more article output from the same customers? More interest from new parties? How would you sort of weigh those two?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you know, in Open Access, the researchers themselves are deciding where to submit their articles. And as they do, they're choosing the titles, meaning the journal titles, and the publishers that they want to work with. So, increasingly,  It's almost a B2C model in that case. And so, things like the reputation, the quality of the customer experience, the researcher experience as they go through the publishing process, the speed with which the article gets out and the quality with which it gets promoted are what drives that.
So, we believe that we're seeing researchers choose us, quite simply stated. If that answers your question, Dan. If I didn't answer it specifically, please follow up.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
No, that helps. Absolutely. Maybe one or two quick follow-ups. The -- given the growth in OA, if we were to break down Research between kind of annual contracted revenue versus more variable or consumption-based, what would that look like at this stage percentage-wise?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, currently, as you look at our -- go ahead, John. Yes.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
I'll answer this in a way that is also responsive, Dan, to your question about what was the composition of revenue in the quarter. Roughly speaking, about 80% of our revenue comes from the combination of subscriptions and open access. And within that, call it, 70% of our research publishing business is subscription and about 10% of it is OA. The remaining 20% of our business, Dan, is, frankly, largely products and services that are derivatives of articles that are published under subscription, such as reprints that you mentioned and such as corporate advertising.
So, that's roughly the split of revenue that we have today. And of course, the subscription base is largely contracted, right? So that's well in play, but we're coming up on a renewal season. You asked whether -- you asked about are there significant backhaul revenues or such in the quarter, and the answer to that is no. This was a pretty normal quarter for us in terms of the composition of products and services that drove our revenue.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
That's helpful because that can be really high margin. One more, and I'll jump out. But you alluded, Brian, to obviously the extraordinary pressures that universities will be facing. Given where the stock is and has been trading, I think there's a lot more fear out there than -- well, may or may not warranted, we'll see.
But I know you don't want to get into the guidance, but when you think about Research, is there a range -- I guess, one, how are those initial dialogues going for calendar '21? And two, is there a range of revenue growth that you might be able to -- at an extreme high, extreme low bracket to sort of rein in some of the fears out there? Maybe  It's too early, but I thought I'd give you the opportunity.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah, look, I mean,  It's a completely fair question, and  It's what we want to know as well. We're talking to our customers very, very closely, and we're trying to get a sense of it. But  It's really early in the renewal season, and so it really is too early to tell.
We do expect some price pressure. But we expect that that price pressure should be offset by this strong growth that you're seeing in OA and in platforms and other areas. So, the simple answer is  It's too early to tell but that we believe that the price pressure we face will be modest and that it will be largely offset, if not more than offset, by our open access growth.

Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, Brian, historically, when GDP has fallen and unemployment has risen, enrollment trends have accelerated. And listening to your preamble, it doesn't sound like that's what you're seeing or anticipating for the fall semester, but just want to get more detail around that.
And then, on a related note, the 4% organic growth for Ed Services that you reported in the quarter, is that indicative of what we should anticipate for the balance of fiscal '21? And then, I have a follow-up.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Got it. So, from the perspective of the demand patterns in higher ed, this -- there's no question that there is a relationship between GDP, unemployment and college enrollment. That -- historically, that relationship has been one with a bit of a lag, a 12 to 18-month lag. And so, we do expect that to play out here, and we believe we're already seeing it in our leads, in our interest and in our enrollment.
But really, traditionally, that's played out over time. What's happening now in enrollment is different than that, though. What's happening now is literally a practical preclusion on universities from running schools as they normally had and a depression or a downward pressure on enrollment that's come from health fears related to being in large groups of people, as everybody knows. So, what we're seeing -- the enrollment pressure we're seeing is not some sort of an inverse relationship to the tradition.
In fact,  It's a novel pressure. And that novel pressure was expected in the fall to be in the neighborhood of 10 or 15%. We think it could be on the lower end of that. But from Wiley's perspective, and this is really important, from Wiley's perspective, our -- and that has -- that, by the way, will affect our principal sales.
But from Wiley's perspective, our strategic growth areas are digital courseware and online education, and those run counter to the trends that we're seeing in the market because if you can't go to school in person, you go online. Or if you're supposed to -- if you're usually in a classroom, but now you're going to be studying from home in a virtual environment, you have no choice but to get the digital materials. You can't share. You can't -- a book is not going to help because you need to be in the courseware.
So, that is contributing to an upswell in the parts of that business that we are strategically focused on in the future. So both in the services business, where we're focused on online enrollment, and in the courseware business or the content business, where we're focused on digital content and courseware, we actually believe that this is a material change that will have a long-term benefit for the business. Then answering second part of your question, we are seeing -- obviously, results are backward-looking. And in the spring, we definitely saw some shock to the system from COVID that affected enrollments.
It just -- this is not surprising. But over this summer, we started to see elevated levels of interest in our -- in lead generation and in conversion, leading to pretty good enrollment trend. So, our enrollment actually was up around 9% recently, and then we should see some of that continue. But again, we're just getting into the semester.
We'll just see exactly how this start goes. And so, we're not at all pessimistic. Quite the contrary, we're optimistic about where that business is going and the enrollment trends due to the things that I've been talking about, both the short-term shift to online translating into a greater acceptance of online learning and online education where it is really is the norm now in many cases for a large portion of people getting postsecondary educations, and then followed by what we expect to be a significant, economically driven increase in interest in education due to the inverse relationship that you identified before between the economy and enrollment in schools.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Got it. OK. Very helpful. And then, I know you spent a lot of time talking about open access, and it, obviously, had a very good quarter.
Just any updated thoughts around the sustainability of that growth? And then, separately, John, can you address the timing-related working capital issues that impacted your cash flow during the quarter?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll pick up the OA question first. We're -- long before COVID, we were seeing significantly greater volumes of submissions and consequent volumes of our output. That has continued and increase through COVID-19.
We see no reason to believe that  It's not going to continue. There might be a slight elevation now that's related to researchers being at home and finishing up papers. You think that would've been done already, and yet the elevated levels continue, and in fact, they're increasing. So, we're very bullish on those volumes levels continuing at a high level on a go-forward basis.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
And then, Drew, on your question with respect to cash flow and, in particular, the impact of working capital that I referenced in my comments, which were the biggest drivers. I mean, by the way, we had very strong performance in the quarter from a real earnings growth perspective, but then working capital played against us. And in particular, I would note that our cash collections associated with journals were pretty strong and in line with our expectations, so we're feeling good about collections there. We do have some customers that have requested extended terms, but  It's not a material impact to our results, and we feel like that's flowing well.
The most significant impact on the timing of working capital has to do with payables. In the March -- late March and April time frame, like others, we went into a bit of cash conservation mode given potential risks around liquidity in the market at that point in time. And so, we put some pressure on payables at that time. And then, as things began to ease up in our first quarter, we also eased up on payables.
So, the ground that we gave up on cash flow in the quarter is particularly concentrated around payables, and  It's just sort of the normal flow back to a balance after conserving cash at the end of the fourth quarter.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
OK. All right guys appreciate it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Sami Kassab with Exane.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my questions, I have three of them, please. The first one is on a topic that I think you've just touched on, but I would kindly like you to perhaps elaborate a little bit more.
On open access, what's the risk that the elevated levels of submissions that we've seen actually reflect the fact that scientists have been locked down at home and away from their labs and had a lot of time to write papers but had no ability to make progress on their scientific research and that those three, four months will actually, six months, 12 months down the road, will lead to a slowdown in open access growth as science did not really happen through the lockdowns? Secondly, on China, we've seen the Chinese government communicate new research appraisal policies, pushing Chinese scientists to publish more into Chinese local language journals, [Inaudible] moving away from splicing. Do you think the China policy and regulatory changes may have an impact, or is that too small to matter? Is that not something that is big on your radar screen? Then lastly, can you elaborate a little bit on how you see the regulatory environment in OPM? We've had the likes of Bob Sherman and Senator Warren look at OPM. Do you think the regulatory environment could be at risk of changing? Or do you think  It's a solid regime that you have today and you have no major concerns on the regulatory front for OPM?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you very much for asking three questions, each of which is a dissertation. So, I'll take them one at a time. They're very good questions, excellent questions that I'd be asking if I were you. So the first one, on the risk of the elevated level of OA sort of bringing back to some lower level later, we are now six or more months into this pandemic; seven or eight, depending on where you're looking in the world.
We continue to see elevated levels. We continue to see researchers putting out papers. Researchers are going back into the labs, absolutely. And so, we're -- we expect it to continue at some level.
Could it come back a little bit? Of course, it could. We're at a very high level right now. But I will remind you that trends in research are very, very positive in terms of overall increasing volume of output in the marketplace. So, in other words, we see mid to high-single-digit increases in the volume of papers every year.
And that long preceded the environment. We consider that will continue in the future. The second thing is that the research continues to be something that is funded at a very high level. In countries around the world, we see no we see no signs of that declining.
So, yeah, I mean, there's no question that there could be a little bit of an artificial increase, but those artificial -- those increases have continued for quite some time now. The final thing I'd say on that is we believe that our publishing program and our approach to publishing is extremely researcher and market friendly, and we think we're getting more than our fair share of submissions. I'll also remind you that of all the submissions we get, we publish a very small portion of them, and so there's always increasing potential there. So, no, I don't see a snapback or a rebound that goes the wrong way on us in the future.
Now, the question of China, another really good question. China is a super important market in the future of research. China is a very important producer and consumer of research. China represents around 5% of our research publishing business now.
So, from a business perspective,  It's not going to swing us one way or the other in any given quarter, but it is very important in the long run, and we are -- and the increasing discussion in China about their endemic -- or indigenous publishing is certainly an important move and important trend. But we have very, very close relationships in China. We have a very good connection to the government agencies and so forth there, and we continue to stay very close to them. Chinese researchers want their journals to be in the best journals in the world so that they can get the recognition and the -- for their work that they desire, and we believe our publishing portfolio leads us there.
But also, we are increasingly partnering in China to make sure that we are seen as the publisher of choice. So, while there is some -- there's always some concern when there are discussions going on in places like China about changes in policy, we believe that, ultimately, we're very well positioned to capitalize on what is still continuing significant growth in both Chinese publishing and Chinese consumption. On the --
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Sorry, may I squeeze in a follow-up before we move to OPM? In subscription unbundling and sub has seen some strong takeup, a third of R1 universities on unsub within less than a year. Do you see a trend or risk toward more unbundling of the big deals, especially in the U.S. as universities face budgetary pressure?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So, if the question is about unbundling and whether we are seeing more or we'll be seeing more, as universities face pressure, they certainly are looking for ways to save cost. I've said we can't really comment on what we expect that pricing pressure to be. But as we look into the market, we don't see a lot of evidence.
We see some one-off cases, but we don't see a lot of evidence of universities and university librarians saying we don't need that content, our researchers don't need it, we're not using it. So, to the extent that we have a high -- which we do, a very high-quality portfolio of journals that is essential to the success of research, we will continue to be purchased by those universities. I'll remind you that academics make their careers based upon research, and universities climb the rankings or to descend in the rankings based upon their positioning in the research ecosystem and both the volume and the quality of their output. So, research and research content is absolutely central to the success of our important clients.
So, while we may see some edge cases because, to be sure, there's pressure in the marketplace, we don't see any sort of any evidence of a large-scale trend toward unbundling. OK. And let me move toward OPM. So, the conversation about OPM has gone on for a long time, and the conversation about the revenue share model has gone on for a long period of time.
We start from the position that we have excellent relationships, long-term relationships with our universities, and we help those universities fundamentally to succeed. We help them to succeed by providing extremely high-quality programs, by attracting students and by matriculating those students at extremely high completion rates, higher completion rates than typically they see in their on-ground programs. So, insofar as we are doing that, we are helping those universities to succeed. There has long been a conversation about the revenue share model.
Our clients seem to be fine with it. Now, to be sure, there will be some movement in the marketplace there, and therefore, Wiley has adopted again, as we always do, very market friendly practices of working with universities on terms that they believe are fair. And we have our bundled revenue share model businesses, we have our fee-for-service businesses and so forth. So, we believe wherever the market goes, we're going to be fine.
Having said that, we participate very closely in the discussions that go on in Washington and elsewhere on the future of education, generally speaking, and on the future of of higher ed and its relationship with service providers. So, we've responded to the various inquiries. They have been ongoing. We expect them to continue to be ongoing.
But we're very close to it, and we are not -- our confidence in the future is based upon the fact that we're in a consensual relationship, if you call it, with our partners, who are getting a tremendous amount out of it. If we, together, or if they decide they want to go in a different direction, we're very happy to go in a different direction with them, and we always have been. So we don't view it as a major threat.  It's something to be talked about,  It's something to be studied,  It's something to be adapted to.
But we are confident in our position and, more importantly, the position and the quality of the services and the value of the services that we provide to the marketplace.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
This is fantastic and all very convincing. You said in your opening remarks that you had higher completion rates. Did you mean that your OPM program has higher completion rate than equivalent on-campus programs have?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Typically speaking, our programs -- I will say, our programs have very high completion rates for the students that start and those that complete the program. I'll remind you that, historically, when the industry has come under pressure, it has been for universities and education providers that have had extremely low completion rates, such that students started but they never finished and, therefore, never got value for the education that they paid for or that somebody else, such as the government or the taxpayer, paid for. That is absolutely not the case in our programs. The completion rates are extremely high, and our clients are happy with them.
And, clearly, students are happy with them because they're staying through to completion and achieving career outcomes that perpetuate the demand for the product.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen. Prior to COVID, rearing its ugly head, margins were eroding. Was that from your conversion from hard copy to digital, or did it relate to state cutbacks in education?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
John, do you want to pick that up?
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, just generally, looking back over fiscal year '20, we did see some erosion of our margin. I would say that the most significant drivers behind that erosion of margin were two. One was the rapid -- continued rapid decline of print, which has reasonably good margins.
But print, as we know, is in decline, and that rate of decline got a bit faster in the past fiscal year and had an impact on our bottom line. We're taking actions, as we discussed in today's review, to improve the profitability of that business by focusing and by, in particular, focusing our future on digital courseware and digital content. The second factor that contributed overall to the shift in the blended margin of the business, there's an increased component of our revenue coming from OPM business that we just talked about. And we recognize that in its current state, the market itself in its current state that operating margins are low.
But we've been emphasizing that we are balancing between top line growth, which is very important to us, and improving profitability there. And we said that we would drive that business to 15% EBITDA margin by next year, and we're well on the march to get there. But those are the two factors that have been putting pressure on our margin, and both of them are being addressed.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
If going forward, there are continued high levels of unemployment, is that a tailwind in that there's a tendency for enrollments in school to go up in that kind of macroeconomic environment?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I'll pick that back up, John. As I was indicating earlier, there is a long term -- and in fact, I think it was either Dan or Drew that pointed it out, there is a long-term established pattern of when the economy goes down and unemployment goes up, that people go back to school. That relationship is typically a lagged relationship, meaning it happens not instantly, it happens 12 to 18 months later, and we do expect to see that.
But we have other tailwinds that are hitting us right now, which is simply that people can't go to school in person. They're physically precluded from going to school fully in person. And so, therefore, we have elevated levels of interest from potential students in taking education in an online world. It also is providing a tailwind, as I indicated earlier, to our digital courseware businesses, which, as I indicated in my remarks, are seeing record increases in usage and adoption because again, if you're not in a physical setting, you need a learning management system based product, something that -- where your teacher can make assignments, where you can do homework, where you can get the content predictably, the content that the teacher needs, not have to Google for your curriculum.
And physical books just aren't as good in those environments. They don't do all those things. And so, there's a significant tailwind that hits you in that sense. And, again, as I indicated, the -- we believe that these are accelerations of long-term trends so that it won't be a short-term blip.
We believe that we're going to see continued elevation of those levels, which is completely -- all of these trends that I'm talking about are completely in sync and aligned with our strategy that we've been working on for the last few years. And  It's gratifying to see it start to come to fruition at a time when the world needs both education and research more than ever.

449,matt@logrocket.com,"Matthew!?!LogRocket!?!In an unprecedented year that saw many teams shift to remote working, we asked tech and business leaders to pick their essential tools.
Throughout our Leaders Insights series on Siliconrepublic.com last year, we asked a host of tech and business leaders from Ireland and further afield to name the essential tools and resources that get them through the working week.
In a year that brought major disruption to most of our working lives, they turned to video conferencing, collaboration software and a whole lot of coffee.
Handy hardware
The move away from offices means many of us are now relying on tech devices for both work and keeping in touch. Seán Keating of Vilicom said his number-one tool is his smartphone. Its like the Swiss army knife of business tools. It keeps me on schedule, navigates to meetings, runs all our most important business apps, connects my laptop to our IT cloud, enables our Teams communications and more.
HPs Gary Tierney said that his phone and laptop are the must-have items for work, but since the arrival of Covid-19 he has been relying more on his laptop. Ive found that working from home has put an even greater emphasis on the criticality of my PC as a communication tool and a general workhorse.
Many people also had to figure out a new at-home work set-up last year. I recently invested in a 38-inch ultra-wide monitor and its been a game changer for me, Joe Lennon of Workvivo told us over the summer.
Video conferencing
2020 was the year we all became very familiar with Zoom (as well as Zoombombing and Zoom fatigue).
Amy Bunszel of Autodesk said she now spends most of her day on Zoom, and Patrick Horgan of Horizon8 said tools such as Zoom are proving incredibly helpful in the work-from-home dynamic.
But there are plenty of other alternatives out there. Microsoft Teams was highlighted as an essential daily tool by plenty of people, including SL Controls Keith Moran, CWSIs Ronan Murphy and Avanades Graham Healy.
Martin McKay of Texthelp said he couldnt be without the Google Meet and Chat tools at the moment, and Xilinxs Brendan Farley said Skype and Webex are other options being used for video calls.
Online collaboration tools are integral to not just our success but our basic functioning, added Ogie Sheehy of ViClarity. Whether it is Zoom or GoToMeeting, Google Chat or Microsoft Teams, these tools are enabling us to continue to work uninterrupted across a global footprint. 
Software saviours
While Microsoft Teams has seen a sharp rise in users in the past year, many companies have been relying on other products from the Microsoft 365 stack. Ronan Murphy of CWSI said these tools allow his company to do whatever we need to do from wherever we are.
SoftwareOnes Una Keeshan said she uses the focus plan in Microsoft MyAnalytics to set aside time for priority work, while Avanades Graham Healy said he uses Microsoft Dynamics for customer relationship management and Power BI for reporting, forecasting and analytics.
With teams dispersed, messaging and collaboration tools such as Slack also came to the fore. Its a convenient way to collaborate over projects and to organise ourselves according to different topics and business functions, said Oz Alashe of CybSafe.
Collaboration tools have always been important for developers. Joe Lennon of Workvivo said GitHub is fundamental for his engineering team to manage source code and code reviews, and they regularly use Tuple to do remote pair programming.
Jennifer Sethre of Intry said Intercom and LogRocket are important tools for her HR tech company, and Keith Moran of SL Controls turns to the Frankli platform for engaging with his team.
Lettertecs Frank Kelly uses Google Keep for jotting quick notes down as they occur, while ViClaritys Ogie Sheehy is a fan of the voice dictation app on his iPhone. It allows me to be immediately responsive to important emails that come through when I am out and about and away from my desk, he said.
A good old-fashioned to-do list
While there may be a fancy tech tool for everything, many leaders still rely on a simple to-do list to keep focused. Nessa McEniff of Learnovate said listing her priorities is a key part of the week and shes a bit of an obsessive list maker.
Netssos Brian ODoherty added that a having a clear list keeps him grounded. I set myself a weekly list and find that its a great way of keeping the faith in myself, my work and my ambitions, he said.
But Liz Cunningham of Google said she is still looking for the perfect tool that will manage all her to-do lists across personal and work life to help keep all the balls in the air.
PayPals Annette Hickey noted that her calendar helps keep her focused throughout the week, and Dells Jason Ward said an organised calendar is key to ensuring I am as productive as possible.
Keeping the mind clear
The sudden shift to remote working means that many have had to find new ways to focus, while still maintaining a good work-life balance and not overworking now that your kitchen may be your office.
To help with this, Nicole Sahin of Globalization Partners said she keeps Fridays free of Zoom meetings. Its like heaven to have that time to think and get things done.
Similarly, Codemas Donna Gartland said that, since the shift to working from home, she now blocks time in her calendar each week without meetings to focus and get deep work done. I use distraction blockers across all my devices, she added, such as Stay Focusd on my browser and Focus mode on Pixel.
Xilinxs Brendan Farley said he removed the work email app from his phone many years ago, which helps him switch off in the evenings. And Mark Cockerill of ServiceNow suggested having a great Spotify playlist on hand.
Getting away from the desk
For minding mental and physical health, many other leaders also suggested getting out and about. SL Controls Keith Moran enjoys a good game of squash in the evening, Arkphires Paul Nannetti tries to run on the beach a few times a week, and Fenergos Louise OConnell said that yoga or a walk in the fresh air can help to just clear the mind.
Una Keeshan of SoftwareOne has recently taken tennis back up as a hobby. The tennis is not only great exercise, she said, but also helps me clear my head from work or the stresses of the day.
And Autodesks Amy Bunszel said that, now she doesnt have a commute for the time being, its a bit easier to make time for exercise every morning and a nice dinner in the evening.
Food certainly plays a key part in the day for many. Horizon8s Patrick Horgan said the barbecue has proved an essential tool for bringing his family together in the current environment.
And one of the essential tools to get Dells Jason Ward through the week? Coffee, coffee and more coffee.",,

432,kj@mentedcosmetics.com,"With $4 billion in sales in 12 months and a rosy forecast ahead, lipstick manufacturers were smiling at the end of 2019, and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing face masks and an unstable economy. With no end to the crisis in sight, brands large and small have had to adjust manufacturing, advertising, and social media on the fly. The results, they say, are paying off — and may mark the beginning of profound changes for the cosmetics industry.
Beyond changes in everyday demand for lip color, some businesses have found themselves re-examining everything from their supply chain up. E.L.F. Beauty, a mass-market brand founded in 2004, reacted to the pandemic earlier than most, according to Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer, because it sources its products abroad. It made changes in early January — weeks before Western countries entered lockdown — when its operation in China was impacted. It has managed to adjust and keep customers supplied, but has noticed a shift in what people are buying. 
Lipstick has slid, most likely because people cared less about the colors of their lips when they're all having to wear masks and the economic fallout of lockdown, but sales of other items rose to pick up the slack.
""We saw a surge in the market around bronzer and brow, so we swiftly deployed assets and messaging to accelerate E.L.F. bronzers and brow products,"" Marchisotto says. ""As we continue navigating through COVID-19, we closely monitor consumer signals and learn that they don't just change monthly or weekly during this crisis. They can change daily or even hourly.""
These shifts are happening across the industry. A May report from McKinsey, the consultancy giant, found cosmetics sales had dropped 55% among prestige brands. ""When consumers do return to work, many will continue to wear masks, further slowing makeup's recovery,"" the report said. However, the report noted that sales of skin-, nail- and hair-care products in Europe had quadrupled, as more people pampered themselves at home — and a September report from market research firm NPD found that more women in the US were using facial skincare products than in 2019.
This constant adjustment has been particularly challenging for independent brands, which may not have the cash or infrastructure to absorb huge drops in sales or swings in their inventory. For Mented, a growing, Black-owned brand with a dedicated following for its highly-pigmented color cosmetics, the pandemic has proved challenging — but surprising, in a good way.
Cofounder Amanda E. Johnson says: ""We were planning on having a great 2020 and then March hit. It was slow in the beginning for everybody, because COVID shook the world and no one knew what was going on. So, we thought, 'oh, we're going to have a horrible year like everyone else.'""
The company adjusted its forecast down 40% and braced for disaster, but was shocked when April's sales figures came in. ""We were like, ""Oh my God, this is the biggest month in the history of the company. It must be an anomaly."" It wasn't. Sales are actually trending up and projections have been readjusted.
Amanda E. Johnson, cofounder and COO of Mented Cosmetics.
Mented Cosmetics
Johnson says the fact the business has always been online only helped — as did its focus on people of color. She also believes that lipstick, despite rising mask-wearing, is finding its place in the pandemic with two very different kinds of consumers. ""One, there's the professional that's working from home. So, if she is working from home, she's on Zoom and Team and Google Hangout calls all day long"" and secondly, ""the essential worker. So, we've asked, why are you still putting on lipstick every day? And what we've heard back is, because 'I need something to make me feel good right now.'""
Marchisotto agrees, predicting the business will keep promoting beauty as an important element of self-care in a difficult time. One nurse wrote to the company saying its primer had changed her life — this kind of direct feedback is important at a time when all historical models of trends are obsolete. ""It was another moment for us to understand the power of our products. We don't just sell beauty."" 
While the path forward is still unclear, Johnson is beginning to think that marketing products as an indulgence could prove successful. ""Women are definitely still buying makeup in droves,"" she says, but adds that the difference is ""they want brands to tell them that they're doing the right thing.""
It remains to be seen which platforms are best for telling buyers that. TikTok, Home Shopping Network, and Instagram have all shown good results for these brands. The message is clearly one consumers want to hear. ""Historically, color cosmetics has been a 'recession-proof product,'"" Johnson said. ""And I think what we're seeing is, in some ways, it is also pandemic proof.""",,

424,kj@mentedcosmetics.com,"With $4 billion in sales in 12 months and a rosy forecast ahead, lipstick manufacturers were smiling at the end of 2019, and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing face masks and an unstable economy. With no end to the crisis in sight, brands large and small have had to adjust manufacturing, advertising, and social media on the fly. The results, they say, are paying off — and may mark the beginning of profound changes for the cosmetics industry.
Beyond changes in everyday demand for lip color, some businesses have found themselves re-examining everything from their supply chain up. E.L.F. Beauty, a mass-market brand founded in 2004, reacted to the pandemic earlier than most, according to Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer, because it sources its products abroad. It made changes in early January — weeks before Western countries entered lockdown — when its operation in China was impacted. It has managed to adjust and keep customers supplied, but has noticed a shift in what people are buying. 
Lipstick has slid, most likely because people cared less about the colors of their lips when they're all having to wear masks and the economic fallout of lockdown, but sales of other items rose to pick up the slack.
""We saw a surge in the market around bronzer and brow, so we swiftly deployed assets and messaging to accelerate E.L.F. bronzers and brow products,"" Marchisotto says. ""As we continue navigating through COVID-19, we closely monitor consumer signals and learn that they don't just change monthly or weekly during this crisis. They can change daily or even hourly.""
These shifts are happening across the industry. A May report from McKinsey, the consultancy giant, found cosmetics sales had dropped 55% among prestige brands. ""When consumers do return to work, many will continue to wear masks, further slowing makeup's recovery,"" the report said. However, the report noted that sales of skin-, nail- and hair-care products in Europe had quadrupled, as more people pampered themselves at home — and a September report from market research firm NPD found that more women in the US were using facial skincare products than in 2019.
This constant adjustment has been particularly challenging for independent brands, which may not have the cash or infrastructure to absorb huge drops in sales or swings in their inventory. For Mented, a growing, Black-owned brand with a dedicated following for its highly-pigmented color cosmetics, the pandemic has proved challenging — but surprising, in a good way.
Cofounder Amanda E. Johnson says: ""We were planning on having a great 2020 and then March hit. It was slow in the beginning for everybody, because COVID shook the world and no one knew what was going on. So, we thought, 'oh, we're going to have a horrible year like everyone else.'""
The company adjusted its forecast down 40% and braced for disaster, but was shocked when April's sales figures came in. ""We were like, ""Oh my God, this is the biggest month in the history of the company. It must be an anomaly."" It wasn't. Sales are actually trending up and projections have been readjusted.
Amanda E. Johnson, cofounder and COO of Mented Cosmetics.
Mented Cosmetics
Johnson says the fact the business has always been online only helped — as did its focus on people of color. She also believes that lipstick, despite rising mask-wearing, is finding its place in the pandemic with two very different kinds of consumers. ""One, there's the professional that's working from home. So, if she is working from home, she's on Zoom and Team and Google Hangout calls all day long"" and secondly, ""the essential worker. So, we've asked, why are you still putting on lipstick every day? And what we've heard back is, because 'I need something to make me feel good right now.'""
Marchisotto agrees, predicting the business will keep promoting beauty as an important element of self-care in a difficult time. One nurse wrote to the company saying its primer had changed her life — this kind of direct feedback is important at a time when all historical models of trends are obsolete. ""It was another moment for us to understand the power of our products. We don't just sell beauty."" 
While the path forward is still unclear, Johnson is beginning to think that marketing products as an indulgence could prove successful. ""Women are definitely still buying makeup in droves,"" she says, but adds that the difference is ""they want brands to tell them that they're doing the right thing.""
It remains to be seen which platforms are best for telling buyers that. TikTok, Home Shopping Network, and Instagram have all shown good results for these brands. The message is clearly one consumers want to hear. ""Historically, color cosmetics has been a 'recession-proof product,'"" Johnson said. ""And I think what we're seeing is, in some ways, it is also pandemic proof.""",,

409,kj@mentedcosmetics.com,"With $4 billion in sales in 12 months and a rosy forecast ahead, lipstick manufacturers were smiling at the end of 2019, and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing face masks and an unstable economy. With no end to the crisis in sight, brands large and small have had to adjust manufacturing, advertising, and social media on the fly. The results, they say, are paying off — and may mark the beginning of profound changes for the cosmetics industry.
Beyond changes in everyday demand for lip color, some businesses have found themselves re-examining everything from their supply chain up. E.L.F. Beauty, a mass-market brand founded in 2004, reacted to the pandemic earlier than most, according to Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer, because it sources its products abroad. It made changes in early January — weeks before Western countries entered lockdown — when its operation in China was impacted. It has managed to adjust and keep customers supplied, but has noticed a shift in what people are buying. 
Lipstick has slid, most likely because people cared less about the colors of their lips when they're all having to wear masks and the economic fallout of lockdown, but sales of other items rose to pick up the slack.
""We saw a surge in the market around bronzer and brow, so we swiftly deployed assets and messaging to accelerate E.L.F. bronzers and brow products,"" Marchisotto says. ""As we continue navigating through COVID-19, we closely monitor consumer signals and learn that they don't just change monthly or weekly during this crisis. They can change daily or even hourly.""
These shifts are happening across the industry. A May report from McKinsey, the consultancy giant, found cosmetics sales had dropped 55% among prestige brands. ""When consumers do return to work, many will continue to wear masks, further slowing makeup's recovery,"" the report said. However, the report noted that sales of skin-, nail- and hair-care products in Europe had quadrupled, as more people pampered themselves at home — and a September report from market research firm NPD found that more women in the US were using facial skincare products than in 2019.
This constant adjustment has been particularly challenging for independent brands, which may not have the cash or infrastructure to absorb huge drops in sales or swings in their inventory. For Mented, a growing, Black-owned brand with a dedicated following for its highly-pigmented color cosmetics, the pandemic has proved challenging — but surprising, in a good way.
Cofounder Amanda E. Johnson says: ""We were planning on having a great 2020 and then March hit. It was slow in the beginning for everybody, because COVID shook the world and no one knew what was going on. So, we thought, 'oh, we're going to have a horrible year like everyone else.'""
The company adjusted its forecast down 40% and braced for disaster, but was shocked when April's sales figures came in. ""We were like, ""Oh my God, this is the biggest month in the history of the company. It must be an anomaly."" It wasn't. Sales are actually trending up and projections have been readjusted.
Amanda E. Johnson, cofounder and COO of Mented Cosmetics.
Mented Cosmetics
Johnson says the fact the business has always been online only helped — as did its focus on people of color. She also believes that lipstick, despite rising mask-wearing, is finding its place in the pandemic with two very different kinds of consumers. ""One, there's the professional that's working from home. So, if she is working from home, she's on Zoom and Team and Google Hangout calls all day long"" and secondly, ""the essential worker. So, we've asked, why are you still putting on lipstick every day? And what we've heard back is, because 'I need something to make me feel good right now.'""
Marchisotto agrees, predicting the business will keep promoting beauty as an important element of self-care in a difficult time. One nurse wrote to the company saying its primer had changed her life — this kind of direct feedback is important at a time when all historical models of trends are obsolete. ""It was another moment for us to understand the power of our products. We don't just sell beauty."" 
While the path forward is still unclear, Johnson is beginning to think that marketing products as an indulgence could prove successful. ""Women are definitely still buying makeup in droves,"" she says, but adds that the difference is ""they want brands to tell them that they're doing the right thing.""
It remains to be seen which platforms are best for telling buyers that. TikTok, Home Shopping Network, and Instagram have all shown good results for these brands. The message is clearly one consumers want to hear. ""Historically, color cosmetics has been a 'recession-proof product,'"" Johnson said. ""And I think what we're seeing is, in some ways, it is also pandemic proof.""","I just read that Mented Cosmetics had a rosy forecast ahead of 2019  and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit  bringing face masks and an unstable economy. Undoubtedly  cosmetics sales has dropped 55% among prestige brands.",

The company adjusted its forecast down 40% and braced for disaster, but was shocked when April's sales figures came in. ""We were like, ""Oh my God, this is the biggest month in the history of the company. It must be an anomaly."" It wasn't. Sales are actually trending up and projections have been readjusted.
Amanda E. Johnson, cofounder and COO of Mented Cosmetics.

Johnson says the fact the business has always been online only helped — as did its focus on people of color. She also believes that lipstick, despite rising mask-wearing, is finding its place in the pandemic with two very different kinds of consumers. ""One, there's the professional that's working from home. So, if she is working from home, she's on Zoom and Team and Google Hangout calls all day long"" and secondly, ""the essential worker. So, we've asked, why are you still putting on lipstick every day? And what we've heard back is, because 'I need something to make me feel good right now.'""
Marchisotto agrees, predicting the business will keep promoting beauty as an important element of self-care in a difficult time. One nurse wrote to the company saying its primer had changed her life — this kind of direct feedback is important at a time when all historical models of trends are obsolete. ""It was another moment for us to understand the power of our products. We don't just sell beauty."" 
While the path forward is still unclear, Johnson is beginning to think that marketing products as an indulgence could prove successful. ""Women are definitely still buying makeup in droves,"" she says, but adds that the difference is ""they want brands to tell them that they're doing the right thing.""
It remains to be seen which platforms are best for telling buyers that. TikTok, Home Shopping Network, and Instagram have all shown good results for these brands. The message is clearly one consumers want to hear. ""Historically, color cosmetics has been a 'recession-proof product,'"" Johnson said. ""And I think what we're seeing is, in some ways, it is also pandemic proof.""",,

398,matt@logrocket.com,"In an unprecedented year that saw many teams shift to remote working, we asked tech and business leaders to pick their essential tools.
Throughout our Leaders Insights series on Siliconrepublic.com last year, we asked a host of tech and business leaders from Ireland and further afield to name the essential tools and resources that get them through the working week.
In a year that brought major disruption to most of our working lives, they turned to video conferencing, collaboration software and a whole lot of coffee.
Handy hardware
The move away from offices means many of us are now relying on tech devices for both work and keeping in touch. Seán Keating of Vilicom said his number-one tool is his smartphone. Its like the Swiss army knife of business tools. It keeps me on schedule, navigates to meetings, runs all our most important business apps, connects my laptop to our IT cloud, enables our Teams communications and more.
HPs Gary Tierney said that his phone and laptop are the must-have items for work, but since the arrival of Covid-19 he has been relying more on his laptop. Ive found that working from home has put an even greater emphasis on the criticality of my PC as a communication tool and a general workhorse.
Many people also had to figure out a new at-home work set-up last year. I recently invested in a 38-inch ultra-wide monitor and its been a game changer for me, Joe Lennon of Workvivo told us over the summer.
Video conferencing
2020 was the year we all became very familiar with Zoom (as well as Zoombombing and Zoom fatigue).
Amy Bunszel of Autodesk said she now spends most of her day on Zoom, and Patrick Horgan of Horizon8 said tools such as Zoom are proving incredibly helpful in the work-from-home dynamic.
But there are plenty of other alternatives out there. Microsoft Teams was highlighted as an essential daily tool by plenty of people, including SL Controls Keith Moran, CWSIs Ronan Murphy and Avanades Graham Healy.
Martin McKay of Texthelp said he couldnt be without the Google Meet and Chat tools at the moment, and Xilinxs Brendan Farley said Skype and Webex are other options being used for video calls.
Online collaboration tools are integral to not just our success but our basic functioning, added Ogie Sheehy of ViClarity. Whether it is Zoom or GoToMeeting, Google Chat or Microsoft Teams, these tools are enabling us to continue to work uninterrupted across a global footprint. 
Software saviours
While Microsoft Teams has seen a sharp rise in users in the past year, many companies have been relying on other products from the Microsoft 365 stack. Ronan Murphy of CWSI said these tools allow his company to do whatever we need to do from wherever we are.
SoftwareOnes Una Keeshan said she uses the focus plan in Microsoft MyAnalytics to set aside time for priority work, while Avanades Graham Healy said he uses Microsoft Dynamics for customer relationship management and Power BI for reporting, forecasting and analytics.
With teams dispersed, messaging and collaboration tools such as Slack also came to the fore. Its a convenient way to collaborate over projects and to organise ourselves according to different topics and business functions, said Oz Alashe of CybSafe.
Collaboration tools have always been important for developers. Joe Lennon of Workvivo said GitHub is fundamental for his engineering team to manage source code and code reviews, and they regularly use Tuple to do remote pair programming.
Jennifer Sethre of Intry said Intercom and LogRocket are important tools for her HR tech company, and Keith Moran of SL Controls turns to the Frankli platform for engaging with his team.
Lettertecs Frank Kelly uses Google Keep for jotting quick notes down as they occur, while ViClaritys Ogie Sheehy is a fan of the voice dictation app on his iPhone. It allows me to be immediately responsive to important emails that come through when I am out and about and away from my desk, he said.
A good old-fashioned to-do list
While there may be a fancy tech tool for everything, many leaders still rely on a simple to-do list to keep focused. Nessa McEniff of Learnovate said listing her priorities is a key part of the week and shes a bit of an obsessive list maker.
Netssos Brian ODoherty added that a having a clear list keeps him grounded. I set myself a weekly list and find that its a great way of keeping the faith in myself, my work and my ambitions, he said.
But Liz Cunningham of Google said she is still looking for the perfect tool that will manage all her to-do lists across personal and work life to help keep all the balls in the air.
PayPals Annette Hickey noted that her calendar helps keep her focused throughout the week, and Dells Jason Ward said an organised calendar is key to ensuring I am as productive as possible.
Keeping the mind clear
The sudden shift to remote working means that many have had to find new ways to focus, while still maintaining a good work-life balance and not overworking now that your kitchen may be your office.
To help with this, Nicole Sahin of Globalization Partners said she keeps Fridays free of Zoom meetings. Its like heaven to have that time to think and get things done.
Similarly, Codemas Donna Gartland said that, since the shift to working from home, she now blocks time in her calendar each week without meetings to focus and get deep work done. I use distraction blockers across all my devices, she added, such as Stay Focusd on my browser and Focus mode on Pixel.
Xilinxs Brendan Farley said he removed the work email app from his phone many years ago, which helps him switch off in the evenings. And Mark Cockerill of ServiceNow suggested having a great Spotify playlist on hand.
Getting away from the desk
For minding mental and physical health, many other leaders also suggested getting out and about. SL Controls Keith Moran enjoys a good game of squash in the evening, Arkphires Paul Nannetti tries to run on the beach a few times a week, and Fenergos Louise OConnell said that yoga or a walk in the fresh air can help to just clear the mind.
Una Keeshan of SoftwareOne has recently taken tennis back up as a hobby. The tennis is not only great exercise, she said, but also helps me clear my head from work or the stresses of the day.
And Autodesks Amy Bunszel said that, now she doesnt have a commute for the time being, its a bit easier to make time for exercise every morning and a nice dinner in the evening.
Food certainly plays a key part in the day for many. Horizon8s Patrick Horgan said the barbecue has proved an essential tool for bringing his family together in the current environment.
And one of the essential tools to get Dells Jason Ward through the week? Coffee, coffee and more coffee.",,
397,kj@mentedcosmetics.com,"With $4 billion in sales in 12 months and a rosy forecast ahead, lipstick manufacturers were smiling at the end of 2019, and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing face masks and an unstable economy. With no end to the crisis in sight, brands large and small have had to adjust manufacturing, advertising, and social media on the fly. The results, they say, are paying off — and may mark the beginning of profound changes for the cosmetics industry.
Beyond changes in everyday demand for lip color, some businesses have found themselves re-examining everything from their supply chain up. E.L.F. Beauty, a mass-market brand founded in 2004, reacted to the pandemic earlier than most, according to Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer, because it sources its products abroad. It made changes in early January — weeks before Western countries entered lockdown — when its operation in China was impacted. It has managed to adjust and keep customers supplied, but has noticed a shift in what people are buying. 
Lipstick has slid, most likely because people cared less about the colors of their lips when they're all having to wear masks and the economic fallout of lockdown, but sales of other items rose to pick up the slack.
""We saw a surge in the market around bronzer and brow, so we swiftly deployed assets and messaging to accelerate E.L.F. bronzers and brow products,"" Marchisotto says. ""As we continue navigating through COVID-19, we closely monitor consumer signals and learn that they don't just change monthly or weekly during this crisis. They can change daily or even hourly.""
These shifts are happening across the industry. A May report from McKinsey, the consultancy giant, found cosmetics sales had dropped 55% among prestige brands. ""When consumers do return to work, many will continue to wear masks, further slowing makeup's recovery,"" the report said. However, the report noted that sales of skin-, nail- and hair-care products in Europe had quadrupled, as more people pampered themselves at home — and a September report from market research firm NPD found that more women in the US were using facial skincare products than in 2019.
This constant adjustment has been particularly challenging for independent brands, which may not have the cash or infrastructure to absorb huge drops in sales or swings in their inventory. For Mented, a growing, Black-owned brand with a dedicated following for its highly-pigmented color cosmetics, the pandemic has proved challenging — but surprising, in a good way.
Cofounder Amanda E. Johnson says: ""We were planning on having a great 2020 and then March hit. It was slow in the beginning for everybody, because COVID shook the world and no one knew what was going on. So, we thought, 'oh, we're going to have a horrible year like everyone else.'""
The company adjusted its forecast down 40% and braced for disaster, but was shocked when April's sales figures came in.

John Wiley &amp; Sons (A Shares) (NYSE:JW-A)Q1 2021 Earnings CallSep 03, 2020, 10:00 a.m. ET
Contents:
<ul><li>Prepared Remarks</li><li>Questions and Answers</li><li>Call Participants</li></ul>Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Wiley's vice president of investor relations, Brian Campbell. Please go ahead.
Brian Campbell -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter 2021 earnings update. On the call with me are Brian Napack, president and chief executive officer; and John Kritzmacher, chief financial officer. A few reminders to start.
The call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. You shouldn't rely on these statements, as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our SEC filings. The company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Wiley provides non-GAAP measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends.
These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under GAAP. Please see the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures presented in the supplementary information included in our press release. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency, unless otherwise specified.
After the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. I'll now turn the call over to Wiley's president and CEO, Brian Napack. 
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Right now, educators and students around the world are heading back to school and researchers are heading back into their labs in a world significantly altered by COVID-19. As they do, they're rewriting the playbooks for education and research. From our vantage point,  It's clear that they're turning to digital content, platforms and services at unprecedented levels, and they're also turning to corporate partners, such as Wiley, who can help them achieve their goals in a changed world.
The result for Wiley is that across the company, demand for our digital products and services has grown markedly. This unusual moment is moving our markets and proving that the strategies that we have been pursuing are not only right for the market today, they are right for where the market is going in the long term. We had a solid first quarter of revenue and earnings performance despite the disrupted environment. This demonstrated both resilience of our business and tight alignment of our strategies with the market's evolving needs.
We'll talk specifics about our performance shortly, but  It's important to note that today's acute health, economic and social problems serve to reinforce the value of Wiley's mission. Over the past months, we've moved faster to validate and publish more research and have made thousands of critical COVID-related research studies freely available. We've helped many universities, schools and corporations around the world to more quickly migrate from traditional to virtual learning. And we spent lots of time in our communities, raised money for causes that address injustice and taking concrete actions to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion within Wiley.
We continue to be reminded of the racial inequality plaguing our society and the need for corporate citizens, such as us, to play an active role in dismantling it. Our global team takes great pride in the fact that their work is truly helping the world to heal, recover, and thrive. Wiley today remains largely in work-from-home mode, although we have partially opened a few offices around the world where local health conditions allow. I want to recognize the great work of our team in executing at a very high level through this challenging period.
Simply stated, the team continues to deliver on our key milestones and customer commitments. In regular surveys, the vast majority of our colleagues report feeling productive and happy, and their engagement is very high. This can be attributed to our strong mission-driven culture, our tech-enabled workflows and our consistent emphasis on colleague care. The pandemic continues to disrupt the global economy, and this has directly impacted some of our more traditional revenue sources, such as physical books and in person training.
But despite these focused headwinds, we're very encouraged by the underlying momentum we're seeing in education and research. This momentum should continue well beyond the pandemic. We've been talking for some time about the positive trends that are driving research and education. Our growth strategy is built on these trends.
I'm pleased to see that they are accelerating at this moment and that Wiley is capitalizing on them. Research output is rising rapidly. Demand for online education and for the digital courseware to support it is also rising rapidly. The acceleration in these areas speaks well to our long-term outlook.
Internally, we are using the moment to lean into our operational excellence. This includes a focus on improving content workflows, our customer journeys our facilities' footprint and more. John will talk about this later, but there is much we have done and much that we continue to do to improve the efficiency of operations. With that, let me summarize the first quarter's results.
As I said, we continue to see COVID-related disruption to printed books and in-person training in the quarter. Offsetting that was strong growth in key strategic areas, including Open Access publishing, research content usage, online student enrollment and digital courseware. The net result was that revenue rose 2%, adjusted EPS rose 124%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 42%. Organic revenue was down 1%.
I'll provide more detail on all of this in our segment discussions. The material earnings improvement this quarter was primarily driven by favorable revenue performance, particularly in Research, lower discretionary spending and savings from restructuring. Corporate expenses alone were down 16% or $7 million. Let's take a look at the segments.
Our research business continues to perform well. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA rose 6 and 19%, respectively. An important note is that about 4 million of our Q1 revenue came from journal subscription renewals that were delayed from Q4 due to COVID-19. That said, our strategies across the Research business continue to bear fruit.
Article output was up 13%. As you know, this is a key driver of our business models.  It's an outcome of good market growth, our strong publishing programs and our market-friendly publishing strategies. We continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth from our open access publishing program.
Our comprehensive national agreements in Europe are performing well with publishing volumes exceeding our expectations. Usage of the Wiley online library is growing strongly, up 10% over prior year. Our industry-leading society publishing program is having another great year. Net society wins will result in around $11 million of incremental publishing revenue in calendar '21.
In June, we signed a 10-year extension of our important Cochrane Library partnership. For reference, Cochrane is the world's preeminent collection of validated evidence for healthcare decision-makers. Our platform revenue rose 10% on new customer launches for Literatum. We continue to consolidate Literatum's industry-leading position in research content distribution, and our customer retention on a trailing 12-month basis was 98%.
Finally, we expanded our partnership with AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is one of the world's largest scientific societies. As part of this, we'll move the full suite of content from science, a globally celebrated family of journals, onto Literatum. This follows our recent announcement that we have also partnered with AAAS to grow their science career center.
I'll provide a bit of forward-looking color for each of our three segments. In research, our strong market position and diversified revenue streams are providing a solid foundation through this time of change. Calendar '20 subscription agreements are locked in through December of this year, and our calendar '21 renewal season just recently started. We do anticipate that COVID-related budget constraints at libraries will result in some price pressure for '21, but  It's too early to quantify.
In any case, we expect to offset this pressure through the continued strong growth of open access, research platforms and corporate solutions. At the same time, we continue to enhance our end-to-end workflows to improve efficiency and enhance the value proposition for researchers. We've made very good progress already, as evidenced in our strong EBITDA performance, reduced publishing cycle times and improved researcher engagement. In summary, we're seeing strong underlying indicators of future growth and long-term customer health.
In academic and professional learning, or APL, the story is an interesting one. The quarter was significantly affected by COVID due to the closure of bookstores, testing centers and corporate offices. Naturally, this affected the more traditional areas of APL, such as print book publishing, Test Prep services and in-person corporate training. The effect was that APL revenue declined 12, 13% organically, and adjusted EBITDA declined 23%.
But despite this short-term pressure, there's good news for the future in our KPIs. We're seeing quite positive trends in digital content and courseware as universities and companies pivot to virtual learning. We appear to be in an inflection point for digital content and digital courseware with record growth of 32 and 88%, respectively, on a pro forma basis. Our strategy to focus tightly on high-demand skills and careers is paying off.
In higher ed, we are gaining market share. Our share has grown from 4% in July 2018 to nearly 5% in July 2020 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our innovative zyBooks and Alta digital offerings are winning adoptions at an impressive pace. For example, zyBooks, our STEM platform, saw revenue double over the prior year, and it is winning consistently in large course adoptions.
So actually, I'm feeling good about the future of APL despite this quarter's COVID-19-related declines in our traditional business lines. For the remainder of the year, we expect that current trends will continue, namely that print book sales will continue to be challenged by COVID lockdowns and virtual learning. Note that print books represent a smaller portion of Wiley's overall business. Digital content and courseware will continue to grow strongly, helping to mitigate any potential decline this fall in higher ed enrollment.
Recovery in test prep will be dependent upon the reopening of testing sites and the resumption of certification exams. In corporate learning, we're seeing an acceleration of our virtual and hybrid corporate training products. We anticipate a strong post-pandemic recovery based upon what we are seeing in platform usage and new partner signings. Throughout APL, we're moving quickly to take advantage of the abrupt shift to digital learning by investing in our platforms and our go-to-market strategies.
This includes our value-driven business models that make content affordable. An example is our Inclusive Access program, which continues to grow very strongly. We are also responding to the moment by publishing timely titles on topics such as running businesses virtually and creating diverse, inclusive and equitable cultures. Finally, we're driving rapid and significant improvement in our cost structure to improve efficiency and our margin profile.
Our education services segment is positioned very well for this moment as universities, students and professionals are pivoting hard to both digital learning and online degrees. It will take time to fully realize the potential of this shift, but interest in our services, which help universities to succeed with online education, is running very high. For the quarter, revenue was up 29%, or 4% organically, and our EBITDA margin was 13%, which is up 9% for fiscal '20. Revenue growth was driven by $12 million of inorganic contribution from M3, as well as 9% growth in student enrollment.
Our mature and new programs are performing well, although organic growth was offset by small partner terminations as part of our continuous portfolio optimization. Our full-service partner count now stands at 67. We added two new full-service university partners in the quarter, the University of New Haven in Connecticut and Carlow University in Pennsylvania, and we signed additional universities for unbundled service agreements. Online program enrollment was very healthy this summer and remains so as we enter the fall semester.
At M3, we found the corporate demand for trained IT talent to be more stable in the pandemic than we had expected. Our existing customer base is solid, and we've begun placing new talent at several recently signed customers. Notably, we're gaining momentum in India where we are currently staffing a major new technology center for one of our global financial services clients. University services are facing significant pressures this year.
Universities are facing significant pressures this year as they simultaneously shift to hybrid and virtual learning while also dealing with financial shortfalls brought on by COVID-related enrollment declines. Although intermediate and long-term trends are very good, there is some near-term uncertainty to manage through with our clients. As with digital courseware, online education is now past the inflection point and is broadly adopted and accepted as a mainstream way to get a degree or certification. This was true before COVID, but the disruption of the past six months has driven home the value of high-quality, fairly priced education that can fit the life and career needs of the broad public.
This moment is reflected in enrollment trends and good pipeline of potential university partnerships, both in the U.S. and abroad and with our key partners, most of whom are evaluating online expansion opportunities. M3's IT talent placement volume is anticipated to be steady for the balance of the year as our corporate partners continue to maintain and grow their tech talent capacity. Major operational focus within education service is the continued improvement of the student journey from lead to enrollment.
These efforts continue to bear fruit in higher conversion rates and lower student acquisition costs. The business is well on track to realize its fiscal '22 goal of the 15% EBITDA margin. I'll now pass the call over to John to take you through our financial profile and optimization initiatives.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Brian. Despite a very challenging environment, we are generally pleased with our revenue and earnings performance for this quarter. That said, our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were unfavorable to prior year by $27 million and $20 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of changes in working capital. As a reminder, our cash flow is normally the use of cash in the first half of our fiscal year due to timing of collection for general subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
Capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, declined $6 million to $24 million for the quarter. As discussed on the last earnings call, we expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, with investment focused on new product and service capabilities, as well as process redesign and workflow automation. With respect to investment in acquisitions, we will remain opportunistic and continue our pursuit of attractive opportunities to add scale and provide enhanced tech-enabled products and services in both research and online education. In terms of our balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was up $117 million primarily due to acquisitions, but our interest expense was lower by $1.5 million as we realized the benefit of the lower interest rate environment.
Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.0 times, inclusive of all acquisitions. In terms of access to capital, we reported $101 million of cash on hand, and we ended the quarter with undrawn revolving credit of $650 million. Our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity afford us the flexibility to continue investing, acquiring and returning cash to shareholders. In June, the company modestly increased its quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.
Our current dividend yield is more than 4%. As a reminder, due to the economic downturn, we have refrained from repurchasing shares. We remain fully confident in our continued strategic momentum, cash generation and liquidity position, and we expect to resume share repurchases as the economic environment recovers. We are moving quickly on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the economic downturn and improve our agility and efficiency.
These programs are companywide and include optimizing our content development workflows, streamlining our customer support operations and achieving benchmark efficiency levels for corporate support functions, such as HR and finance. Meanwhile, we continue to maintain tight controls on discretionary spending across the company, and we have realized significant savings on travel, marketing events and professional fees. In addition, hiring and salary increases have been strictly limited to critical business needs and investment in our top performers. And in June, the executive leadership team and the board unanimously agreed to take six-month pay cuts ranging from 15% to 30%.
And as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a $15 million restructuring charge for actions that will generate annual run rate savings of approximately $30 million. Additional cost savings actions are anticipated in the current fiscal year. As an example, we are taking actions to rationalize our real estate portfolio given our successful transition to a virtual work environment. We will update you on our progress as the anticipated savings -- and the anticipated savings we will make throughout the year.
In summary, we are very well positioned to navigate the COVID-related challenges ahead while investing in key optimization and growth initiatives. As a reminder, given our limited visibility in the current economic environment, we have suspended our practice of providing annual guidance. We expect to return to providing guidance when the economic environment becomes more stable and our visibility improves. I'll now pass the call back to Brian.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. So, to recap the main messages for today, our business remains strong through the pandemic with good momentum continuing in both research and education services. We're experiencing COVID-related disruptions to print books and in-person training. Of course, this represents a smaller part of Wiley today, with nearly 80% of our revenue coming from digital products and tech-enabled services.
Core trends remain favorable in Wiley's key strategic areas of focus, such as peer-reviewed research, online education, digital content and courseware. We're taking full advantage of this unusual moment to drive improvement in the cost structure and core functioning of Wiley, focusing on high potential areas, such as our content development workflows, our management of the customer life cycle and the tuning of our real estate footprint for an increasingly virtual workforce. Overall, we're confident in the enduring importance of our Research and Education content, platforms and services. But more importantly, we're optimistic that this challenging moment -- at this challenging moment because we're seeing compelling evidence in our KPIs that our markets are strong and that our strategies are working.
To be specific, we're experiencing strong growth in demand to publish in our journals and consumer research, strong growth in Research platform signings, recurring revenue and content consumption with 98% client retention, strong growth in our digital courseware portfolio, strong growth in enrollment at our online degree programs and increased interest of universities in accelerating the transition to online education. So despite some near-term headwinds, the data tells me that we're tightly aligned with the current and long-term needs of our customers, the researchers, students, professors, administrators and corporate leaders that we serve worldwide. Once again, I want to thank our wonderful Wiley colleagues around the world for their grit, their positive spirit and their remarkable accomplishments this quarter. With that, I'll open the floor to your comments and questions.
Questions &amp; Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with research. Obviously, a really solid growth in a difficult environment.
How much of the jump in article output and content consumption would you contribute to COVID-related research? And as a follow-up, how much of the jump in research revenue and EBITDA reflects things like reprints and back files, open access? Just trying to get a sense for that relative to maybe the kind of legacy Research business, if you will.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start, and John can chip in. So, we're seeing -- definitely seeing good momentum in Research publishing. The COVID crisis has definitely increased the interest in -- or the output of researchers, and we see no signs of that declining.
With respect to specific COVID-related research, we certainly are publishing more COVID-related papers, as you would expect. But as a percentage of our total,  It's a very small percentage.  It's really a much broader --  It's a much broader increase in demand that we're seeing at this point in time that's coming across the portfolio. And to answer your second question, a large portion of that is coming in open access.
So, we're seeing really good growth rates in our open access pay-to-publish models, which, as you know, is a price times quantity model. So, when that happens, that translates directly into our revenue base. So we're definitely feeling consistent and increasing demand. And the practices that we've taken in the marketplace, which have been very market friendly, we believe, are leading researchers to choose Wiley and choose our journal.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Indeed. And on OA specifically, is it more article output from the same customers? More interest from new parties? How would you sort of weigh those two?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you know, in Open Access, the researchers themselves are deciding where to submit their articles. And as they do, they're choosing the titles, meaning the journal titles, and the publishers that they want to work with. So, increasingly,  It's almost a B2C model in that case. And so, things like the reputation, the quality of the customer experience, the researcher experience as they go through the publishing process, the speed with which the article gets out and the quality with which it gets promoted are what drives that.
So, we believe that we're seeing researchers choose us, quite simply stated. If that answers your question, Dan. If I didn't answer it specifically, please follow up.

No, that helps. Absolutely. Maybe one or two quick follow-ups. The -- given the growth in OA, if we were to break down Research between kind of annual contracted revenue versus more variable or consumption-based, what would that look like at this stage percentage-wise?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, currently, as you look at our -- go ahead, John. Yes.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
I'll answer this in a way that is also responsive, Dan, to your question about what was the composition of revenue in the quarter. Roughly speaking, about 80% of our revenue comes from the combination of subscriptions and open access. And within that, call it, 70% of our research publishing business is subscription and about 10% of it is OA. The remaining 20% of our business, Dan, is, frankly, largely products and services that are derivatives of articles that are published under subscription, such as reprints that you mentioned and such as corporate advertising.
So, that's roughly the split of revenue that we have today. And of course, the subscription base is largely contracted, right? So that's well in play, but we're coming up on a renewal season. You asked whether -- you asked about are there significant backhaul revenues or such in the quarter, and the answer to that is no. This was a pretty normal quarter for us in terms of the composition of products and services that drove our revenue.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
That's helpful because that can be really high margin. One more, and I'll jump out. But you alluded, Brian, to obviously the extraordinary pressures that universities will be facing. Given where the stock is and has been trading, I think there's a lot more fear out there than -- well, may or may not warranted, we'll see.
But I know you don't want to get into the guidance, but when you think about Research, is there a range -- I guess, one, how are those initial dialogues going for calendar '21? And two, is there a range of revenue growth that you might be able to -- at an extreme high, extreme low bracket to sort of rein in some of the fears out there? Maybe  It's too early, but I thought I'd give you the opportunity.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah, look, I mean,  It's a completely fair question, and  It's what we want to know as well. We're talking to our customers very, very closely, and we're trying to get a sense of it. But  It's really early in the renewal season, and so it really is too early to tell.
We do expect some price pressure. But we expect that that price pressure should be offset by this strong growth that you're seeing in OA and in platforms and other areas. So, the simple answer is  It's too early to tell but that we believe that the price pressure we face will be modest and that it will be largely offset, if not more than offset, by our open access growth.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
OK. Helpful. I'll follow up with -- jump back in queue with any follow-up.

Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, Brian, historically, when GDP has fallen and unemployment has risen, enrollment trends have accelerated. And listening to your preamble, it doesn't sound like that's what you're seeing or anticipating for the fall semester, but just want to get more detail around that.
And then, on a related note, the 4% organic growth for Ed Services that you reported in the quarter, is that indicative of what we should anticipate for the balance of fiscal '21? And then, I have a follow-up.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Got it. So, from the perspective of the demand patterns in higher ed, this -- there's no question that there is a relationship between GDP, unemployment and college enrollment. That -- historically, that relationship has been one with a bit of a lag, a 12 to 18-month lag. And so, we do expect that to play out here, and we believe we're already seeing it in our leads, in our interest and in our enrollment.
But really, traditionally, that's played out over time. What's happening now in enrollment is different than that, though. What's happening now is literally a practical preclusion on universities from running schools as they normally had and a depression or a downward pressure on enrollment that's come from health fears related to being in large groups of people, as everybody knows. So, what we're seeing -- the enrollment pressure we're seeing is not some sort of an inverse relationship to the tradition.
In fact,  It's a novel pressure. And that novel pressure was expected in the fall to be in the neighborhood of 10 or 15%. We think it could be on the lower end of that. But from Wiley's perspective, and this is really important, from Wiley's perspective, our -- and that has -- that, by the way, will affect our principal sales.
But from Wiley's perspective, our strategic growth areas are digital courseware and online education, and those run counter to the trends that we're seeing in the market because if you can't go to school in person, you go online. Or if you're supposed to -- if you're usually in a classroom, but now you're going to be studying from home in a virtual environment, you have no choice but to get the digital materials. You can't share. You can't -- a book is not going to help because you need to be in the courseware.
So, that is contributing to an upswell in the parts of that business that we are strategically focused on in the future. So both in the services business, where we're focused on online enrollment, and in the courseware business or the content business, where we're focused on digital content and courseware, we actually believe that this is a material change that will have a long-term benefit for the business. Then answering second part of your question, we are seeing -- obviously, results are backward-looking. And in the spring, we definitely saw some shock to the system from COVID that affected enrollments.
It just -- this is not surprising. But over this summer, we started to see elevated levels of interest in our -- in lead generation and in conversion, leading to pretty good enrollment trend. So, our enrollment actually was up around 9% recently, and then we should see some of that continue. But again, we're just getting into the semester.
We'll just see exactly how this start goes. And so, we're not at all pessimistic. Quite the contrary, we're optimistic about where that business is going and the enrollment trends due to the things that I've been talking about, both the short-term shift to online translating into a greater acceptance of online learning and online education where it is really is the norm now in many cases for a large portion of people getting postsecondary educations, and then followed by what we expect to be a significant, economically driven increase in interest in education due to the inverse relationship that you identified before between the economy and enrollment in schools.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Got it. OK. Very helpful. And then, I know you spent a lot of time talking about open access, and it, obviously, had a very good quarter.
Just any updated thoughts around the sustainability of that growth? And then, separately, John, can you address the timing-related working capital issues that impacted your cash flow during the quarter?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll pick up the OA question first. We're -- long before COVID, we were seeing significantly greater volumes of submissions and consequent volumes of our output. That has continued and increase through COVID-19.
We see no reason to believe that  It's not going to continue. There might be a slight elevation now that's related to researchers being at home and finishing up papers. You think that would've been done already, and yet the elevated levels continue, and in fact, they're increasing. So, we're very bullish on those volumes levels continuing at a high level on a go-forward basis.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
And then, Drew, on your question with respect to cash flow and, in particular, the impact of working capital that I referenced in my comments, which were the biggest drivers. I mean, by the way, we had very strong performance in the quarter from a real earnings growth perspective, but then working capital played against us. And in particular, I would note that our cash collections associated with journals were pretty strong and in line with our expectations, so we're feeling good about collections there. We do have some customers that have requested extended terms, but  It's not a material impact to our results, and we feel like that's flowing well.
The most significant impact on the timing of working capital has to do with payables. In the March -- late March and April time frame, like others, we went into a bit of cash conservation mode given potential risks around liquidity in the market at that point in time. And so, we put some pressure on payables at that time. And then, as things began to ease up in our first quarter, we also eased up on payables.
So, the ground that we gave up on cash flow in the quarter is particularly concentrated around payables, and  It's just sort of the normal flow back to a balance after conserving cash at the end of the fourth quarter.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
OK. All right guys appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Sami Kassab with Exane.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my questions, I have three of them, please. The first one is on a topic that I think you've just touched on, but I would kindly like you to perhaps elaborate a little bit more.
On open access, what's the risk that the elevated levels of submissions that we've seen actually reflect the fact that scientists have been locked down at home and away from their labs and had a lot of time to write papers but had no ability to make progress on their scientific research and that those three, four months will actually, six months, 12 months down the road, will lead to a slowdown in open access growth as science did not really happen through the lockdowns? Secondly, on China, we've seen the Chinese government communicate new research appraisal policies, pushing Chinese scientists to publish more into Chinese local language journals, [Inaudible] moving away from splicing. Do you think the China policy and regulatory changes may have an impact, or is that too small to matter? Is that not something that is big on your radar screen? Then lastly, can you elaborate a little bit on how you see the regulatory environment in OPM? We've had the likes of Bob Sherman and Senator Warren look at OPM. Do you think the regulatory environment could be at risk of changing? Or do you think  It's a solid regime that you have today and you have no major concerns on the regulatory front for OPM?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you very much for asking three questions, each of which is a dissertation. So, I'll take them one at a time. They're very good questions, excellent questions that I'd be asking if I were you. So the first one, on the risk of the elevated level of OA sort of bringing back to some lower level later, we are now six or more months into this pandemic; seven or eight, depending on where you're looking in the world.
We continue to see elevated levels. We continue to see researchers putting out papers. Researchers are going back into the labs, absolutely. And so, we're -- we expect it to continue at some level.
Could it come back a little bit? Of course, it could. We're at a very high level right now. But I will remind you that trends in research are very, very positive in terms of overall increasing volume of output in the marketplace. So, in other words, we see mid to high-single-digit increases in the volume of papers every year.
And that long preceded the environment. We consider that will continue in the future. The second thing is that the research continues to be something that is funded at a very high level. In countries around the world, we see no we see no signs of that declining.
So, yeah, I mean, there's no question that there could be a little bit of an artificial increase, but those artificial -- those increases have continued for quite some time now. The final thing I'd say on that is we believe that our publishing program and our approach to publishing is extremely researcher and market friendly, and we think we're getting more than our fair share of submissions. I'll also remind you that of all the submissions we get, we publish a very small portion of them, and so there's always increasing potential there. So, no, I don't see a snapback or a rebound that goes the wrong way on us in the future.
Now, the question of China, another really good question. China is a super important market in the future of research. China is a very important producer and consumer of research. China represents around 5% of our research publishing business now.
So, from a business perspective,  It's not going to swing us one way or the other in any given quarter, but it is very important in the long run, and we are -- and the increasing discussion in China about their endemic -- or indigenous publishing is certainly an important move and important trend. But we have very, very close relationships in China. We have a very good connection to the government agencies and so forth there, and we continue to stay very close to them. Chinese researchers want their journals to be in the best journals in the world so that they can get the recognition and the -- for their work that they desire, and we believe our publishing portfolio leads us there.
But also, we are increasingly partnering in China to make sure that we are seen as the publisher of choice. So, while there is some -- there's always some concern when there are discussions going on in places like China about changes in policy, we believe that, ultimately, we're very well positioned to capitalize on what is still continuing significant growth in both Chinese publishing and Chinese consumption. On the --
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Sorry, may I squeeze in a follow-up before we move to OPM? In subscription unbundling and sub has seen some strong takeup, a third of R1 universities on unsub within less than a year. Do you see a trend or risk toward more unbundling of the big deals, especially in the U.S. as universities face budgetary pressure?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So, if the question is about unbundling and whether we are seeing more or we'll be seeing more, as universities face pressure, they certainly are looking for ways to save cost. I've said we can't really comment on what we expect that pricing pressure to be. But as we look into the market, we don't see a lot of evidence.
We see some one-off cases, but we don't see a lot of evidence of universities and university librarians saying we don't need that content, our researchers don't need it, we're not using it. So, to the extent that we have a high -- which we do, a very high-quality portfolio of journals that is essential to the success of research, we will continue to be purchased by those universities. I'll remind you that academics make their careers based upon research, and universities climb the rankings or to descend in the rankings based upon their positioning in the research ecosystem and both the volume and the quality of their output. So, research and research content is absolutely central to the success of our important clients.
So, while we may see some edge cases because, to be sure, there's pressure in the marketplace, we don't see any sort of any evidence of a large-scale trend toward unbundling. OK. And let me move toward OPM. So, the conversation about OPM has gone on for a long time, and the conversation about the revenue share model has gone on for a long period of time.
We start from the position that we have excellent relationships, long-term relationships with our universities, and we help those universities fundamentally to succeed. We help them to succeed by providing extremely high-quality programs, by attracting students and by matriculating those students at extremely high completion rates, higher completion rates than typically they see in their on-ground programs. So, insofar as we are doing that, we are helping those universities to succeed. There has long been a conversation about the revenue share model.
Our clients seem to be fine with it. Now, to be sure, there will be some movement in the marketplace there, and therefore, Wiley has adopted again, as we always do, very market friendly practices of working with universities on terms that they believe are fair. And we have our bundled revenue share model businesses, we have our fee-for-service businesses and so forth. So, we believe wherever the market goes, we're going to be fine.
Having said that, we participate very closely in the discussions that go on in Washington and elsewhere on the future of education, generally speaking, and on the future of of higher ed and its relationship with service providers. So, we've responded to the various inquiries. They have been ongoing. We expect them to continue to be ongoing.
But we're very close to it, and we are not -- our confidence in the future is based upon the fact that we're in a consensual relationship, if you call it, with our partners, who are getting a tremendous amount out of it. If we, together, or if they decide they want to go in a different direction, we're very happy to go in a different direction with them, and we always have been. So we don't view it as a major threat.  It's something to be talked about,  It's something to be studied,  It's something to be adapted to.
But we are confident in our position and, more importantly, the position and the quality of the services and the value of the services that we provide to the marketplace.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
This is fantastic and all very convincing. You said in your opening remarks that you had higher completion rates. Did you mean that your OPM program has higher completion rate than equivalent on-campus programs have?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Typically speaking, our programs -- I will say, our programs have very high completion rates for the students that start and those that complete the program. I'll remind you that, historically, when the industry has come under pressure, it has been for universities and education providers that have had extremely low completion rates, such that students started but they never finished and, therefore, never got value for the education that they paid for or that somebody else, such as the government or the taxpayer, paid for. That is absolutely not the case in our programs. The completion rates are extremely high, and our clients are happy with them.
And, clearly, students are happy with them because they're staying through to completion and achieving career outcomes that perpetuate the demand for the product.

Our next question comes from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen. Prior to COVID, rearing its ugly head, margins were eroding. Was that from your conversion from hard copy to digital, or did it relate to state cutbacks in education?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
John, do you want to pick that up?
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, just generally, looking back over fiscal year '20, we did see some erosion of our margin. I would say that the most significant drivers behind that erosion of margin were two. One was the rapid -- continued rapid decline of print, which has reasonably good margins.
But print, as we know, is in decline, and that rate of decline got a bit faster in the past fiscal year and had an impact on our bottom line. We're taking actions, as we discussed in today's review, to improve the profitability of that business by focusing and by, in particular, focusing our future on digital courseware and digital content. The second factor that contributed overall to the shift in the blended margin of the business, there's an increased component of our revenue coming from OPM business that we just talked about. And we recognize that in its current state, the market itself in its current state that operating margins are low.
But we've been emphasizing that we are balancing between top line growth, which is very important to us, and improving profitability there. And we said that we would drive that business to 15% EBITDA margin by next year, and we're well on the march to get there. But those are the two factors that have been putting pressure on our margin, and both of them are being addressed.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
If going forward, there are continued high levels of unemployment, is that a tailwind in that there's a tendency for enrollments in school to go up in that kind of macroeconomic environment?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I'll pick that back up, John. As I was indicating earlier, there is a long term -- and in fact, I think it was either Dan or Drew that pointed it out, there is a long-term established pattern of when the economy goes down and unemployment goes up, that people go back to school. That relationship is typically a lagged relationship, meaning it happens not instantly, it happens 12 to 18 months later, and we do expect to see that.
But we have other tailwinds that are hitting us right now, which is simply that people can't go to school in person. They're physically precluded from going to school fully in person. And so, therefore, we have elevated levels of interest from potential students in taking education in an online world. It also is providing a tailwind, as I indicated earlier, to our digital courseware businesses, which, as I indicated in my remarks, are seeing record increases in usage and adoption because again, if you're not in a physical setting, you need a learning management system based product, something that -- where your teacher can make assignments, where you can do homework, where you can get the content predictably, the content that the teacher needs, not have to Google for your curriculum.
And physical books just aren't as good in those environments. They don't do all those things. And so, there's a significant tailwind that hits you in that sense. And, again, as I indicated, the -- we believe that these are accelerations of long-term trends so that it won't be a short-term blip.
We believe that we're going to see continued elevation of those levels, which is completely -- all of these trends that I'm talking about are completely in sync and aligned with our strategy that we've been working on for the last few years. And  It's gratifying to see it start to come to fruition at a time when the world needs both education and research more than ever.

Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Wiley's vice president of investor relations, Brian Campbell. Please go ahead.
Brian Campbell -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter 2021 earnings update. On the call with me are Brian Napack, president and chief executive officer; and John Kritzmacher, chief financial officer. A few reminders to start.
The call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. You shouldn't rely on these statements, as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our SEC filings. The company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Wiley provides non-GAAP measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends.
These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under GAAP. Please see the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures presented in the supplementary information included in our press release. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency, unless otherwise specified.
After the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. I'll now turn the call over to Wiley's president and CEO, Brian Napack. 
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Right now, educators and students around the world are heading back to school and researchers are heading back into their labs in a world significantly altered by COVID-19. As they do, they're rewriting the playbooks for education and research. From our vantage point,  It's clear that they're turning to digital content, platforms and services at unprecedented levels, and they're also turning to corporate partners, such as Wiley, who can help them achieve their goals in a changed world.
The result for Wiley is that across the company, demand for our digital products and services has grown markedly. This unusual moment is moving our markets and proving that the strategies that we have been pursuing are not only right for the market today, they are right for where the market is going in the long term. We had a solid first quarter of revenue and earnings performance despite the disrupted environment. This demonstrated both resilience of our business and tight alignment of our strategies with the market's evolving needs.
We'll talk specifics about our performance shortly, but  It's important to note that today's acute health, economic and social problems serve to reinforce the value of Wiley's mission. Over the past months, we've moved faster to validate and publish more research and have made thousands of critical COVID-related research studies freely available. We've helped many universities, schools and corporations around the world to more quickly migrate from traditional to virtual learning. And we spent lots of time in our communities, raised money for causes that address injustice and taking concrete actions to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion within Wiley.
We continue to be reminded of the racial inequality plaguing our society and the need for corporate citizens, such as us, to play an active role in dismantling it. Our global team takes great pride in the fact that their work is truly helping the world to heal, recover, and thrive. Wiley today remains largely in work-from-home mode, although we have partially opened a few offices around the world where local health conditions allow. I want to recognize the great work of our team in executing at a very high level through this challenging period.
Simply stated, the team continues to deliver on our key milestones and customer commitments. In regular surveys, the vast majority of our colleagues report feeling productive and happy, and their engagement is very high. This can be attributed to our strong mission-driven culture, our tech-enabled workflows and our consistent emphasis on colleague care. The pandemic continues to disrupt the global economy, and this has directly impacted some of our more traditional revenue sources, such as physical books and in person training.
But despite these focused headwinds, we're very encouraged by the underlying momentum we're seeing in education and research. This momentum should continue well beyond the pandemic. We've been talking for some time about the positive trends that are driving research and education. Our growth strategy is built on these trends.
I'm pleased to see that they are accelerating at this moment and that Wiley is capitalizing on them. Research output is rising rapidly. Demand for online education and for the digital courseware to support it is also rising rapidly. The acceleration in these areas speaks well to our long-term outlook.
Internally, we are using the moment to lean into our operational excellence. This includes a focus on improving content workflows, our customer journeys our facilities' footprint and more. John will talk about this later, but there is much we have done and much that we continue to do to improve the efficiency of operations. With that, let me summarize the first quarter's results.
As I said, we continue to see COVID-related disruption to printed books and in-person training in the quarter. Offsetting that was strong growth in key strategic areas, including Open Access publishing, research content usage, online student enrollment and digital courseware. The net result was that revenue rose 2%, adjusted EPS rose 124%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 42%. Organic revenue was down 1%.
I'll provide more detail on all of this in our segment discussions. The material earnings improvement this quarter was primarily driven by favorable revenue performance, particularly in Research, lower discretionary spending and savings from restructuring. Corporate expenses alone were down 16% or $7 million. Let's take a look at the segments.
Our research business continues to perform well. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA rose 6 and 19%, respectively. An important note is that about 4 million of our Q1 revenue came from journal subscription renewals that were delayed from Q4 due to COVID-19. That said, our strategies across the Research business continue to bear fruit.
Article output was up 13%. As you know, this is a key driver of our business models.  It's an outcome of good market growth, our strong publishing programs and our market-friendly publishing strategies. We continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth from our open access publishing program.
Our comprehensive national agreements in Europe are performing well with publishing volumes exceeding our expectations. Usage of the Wiley online library is growing strongly, up 10% over prior year. Our industry-leading society publishing program is having another great year. Net society wins will result in around $11 million of incremental publishing revenue in calendar '21.
In June, we signed a 10-year extension of our important Cochrane Library partnership. For reference, Cochrane is the world's preeminent collection of validated evidence for healthcare decision-makers. Our platform revenue rose 10% on new customer launches for Literatum. We continue to consolidate Literatum's industry-leading position in research content distribution, and our customer retention on a trailing 12-month basis was 98%.
Finally, we expanded our partnership with AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is one of the world's largest scientific societies. As part of this, we'll move the full suite of content from science, a globally celebrated family of journals, onto Literatum. This follows our recent announcement that we have also partnered with AAAS to grow their science career center.
I'll provide a bit of forward-looking color for each of our three segments. In research, our strong market position and diversified revenue streams are providing a solid foundation through this time of change. Calendar '20 subscription agreements are locked in through December of this year, and our calendar '21 renewal season just recently started. We do anticipate that COVID-related budget constraints at libraries will result in some price pressure for '21, but  It's too early to quantify.
In any case, we expect to offset this pressure through the continued strong growth of open access, research platforms and corporate solutions. At the same time, we continue to enhance our end-to-end workflows to improve efficiency and enhance the value proposition for researchers. We've made very good progress already, as evidenced in our strong EBITDA performance, reduced publishing cycle times and improved researcher engagement. In summary, we're seeing strong underlying indicators of future growth and long-term customer health.
In academic and professional learning, or APL, the story is an interesting one. The quarter was significantly affected by COVID due to the closure of bookstores, testing centers and corporate offices. Naturally, this affected the more traditional areas of APL, such as print book publishing, Test Prep services and in-person corporate training. The effect was that APL revenue declined 12, 13% organically, and adjusted EBITDA declined 23%.
But despite this short-term pressure, there's good news for the future in our KPIs. We're seeing quite positive trends in digital content and courseware as universities and companies pivot to virtual learning. We appear to be in an inflection point for digital content and digital courseware with record growth of 32 and 88%, respectively, on a pro forma basis. Our strategy to focus tightly on high-demand skills and careers is paying off.
In higher ed, we are gaining market share. Our share has grown from 4% in July 2018 to nearly 5% in July 2020 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our innovative zyBooks and Alta digital offerings are winning adoptions at an impressive pace. For example, zyBooks, our STEM platform, saw revenue double over the prior year, and it is winning consistently in large course adoptions.
So actually, I'm feeling good about the future of APL despite this quarter's COVID-19-related declines in our traditional business lines. For the remainder of the year, we expect that current trends will continue, namely that print book sales will continue to be challenged by COVID lockdowns and virtual learning. Note that print books represent a smaller portion of Wiley's overall business. Digital content and courseware will continue to grow strongly, helping to mitigate any potential decline this fall in higher ed enrollment.
Recovery in test prep will be dependent upon the reopening of testing sites and the resumption of certification exams. In corporate learning, we're seeing an acceleration of our virtual and hybrid corporate training products. We anticipate a strong post-pandemic recovery based upon what we are seeing in platform usage and new partner signings. Throughout APL, we're moving quickly to take advantage of the abrupt shift to digital learning by investing in our platforms and our go-to-market strategies.
This includes our value-driven business models that make content affordable. An example is our Inclusive Access program, which continues to grow very strongly. We are also responding to the moment by publishing timely titles on topics such as running businesses virtually and creating diverse, inclusive and equitable cultures. Finally, we're driving rapid and significant improvement in our cost structure to improve efficiency and our margin profile.
Our education services segment is positioned very well for this moment as universities, students and professionals are pivoting hard to both digital learning and online degrees. It will take time to fully realize the potential of this shift, but interest in our services, which help universities to succeed with online education, is running very high. For the quarter, revenue was up 29%, or 4% organically, and our EBITDA margin was 13%, which is up 9% for fiscal '20. Revenue growth was driven by $12 million of inorganic contribution from M3, as well as 9% growth in student enrollment.
Our mature and new programs are performing well, although organic growth was offset by small partner terminations as part of our continuous portfolio optimization. Our full-service partner count now stands at 67. We added two new full-service university partners in the quarter, the University of New Haven in Connecticut and Carlow University in Pennsylvania, and we signed additional universities for unbundled service agreements. Online program enrollment was very healthy this summer and remains so as we enter the fall semester.
At M3, we found the corporate demand for trained IT talent to be more stable in the pandemic than we had expected. Our existing customer base is solid, and we've begun placing new talent at several recently signed customers. Notably, we're gaining momentum in India where we are currently staffing a major new technology center for one of our global financial services clients. University services are facing significant pressures this year.
Universities are facing significant pressures this year as they simultaneously shift to hybrid and virtual learning while also dealing with financial shortfalls brought on by COVID-related enrollment declines. Although intermediate and long-term trends are very good, there is some near-term uncertainty to manage through with our clients. As with digital courseware, online education is now past the inflection point and is broadly adopted and accepted as a mainstream way to get a degree or certification. This was true before COVID, but the disruption of the past six months has driven home the value of high-quality, fairly priced education that can fit the life and career needs of the broad public.
This moment is reflected in enrollment trends and good pipeline of potential university partnerships, both in the U.S. and abroad and with our key partners, most of whom are evaluating online expansion opportunities. M3's IT talent placement volume is anticipated to be steady for the balance of the year as our corporate partners continue to maintain and grow their tech talent capacity. Major operational focus within education service is the continued improvement of the student journey from lead to enrollment.
These efforts continue to bear fruit in higher conversion rates and lower student acquisition costs. The business is well on track to realize its fiscal '22 goal of the 15% EBITDA margin. I'll now pass the call over to John to take you through our financial profile and optimization initiatives.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Brian. Despite a very challenging environment, we are generally pleased with our revenue and earnings performance for this quarter. That said, our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were unfavorable to prior year by $27 million and $20 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of changes in working capital. As a reminder, our cash flow is normally the use of cash in the first half of our fiscal year due to timing of collection for general subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
Capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, declined $6 million to $24 million for the quarter. As discussed on the last earnings call, we expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, with investment focused on new product and service capabilities, as well as process redesign and workflow automation. With respect to investment in acquisitions, we will remain opportunistic and continue our pursuit of attractive opportunities to add scale and provide enhanced tech-enabled products and services in both research and online education. In terms of our balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was up $117 million primarily due to acquisitions, but our interest expense was lower by $1.5 million as we realized the benefit of the lower interest rate environment.
Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.0 times, inclusive of all acquisitions. In terms of access to capital, we reported $101 million of cash on hand, and we ended the quarter with undrawn revolving credit of $650 million. Our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity afford us the flexibility to continue investing, acquiring and returning cash to shareholders. In June, the company modestly increased its quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.
Our current dividend yield is more than 4%. As a reminder, due to the economic downturn, we have refrained from repurchasing shares. We remain fully confident in our continued strategic momentum, cash generation and liquidity position, and we expect to resume share repurchases as the economic environment recovers. We are moving quickly on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the economic downturn and improve our agility and efficiency.
These programs are companywide and include optimizing our content development workflows, streamlining our customer support operations and achieving benchmark efficiency levels for corporate support functions, such as HR and finance. Meanwhile, we continue to maintain tight controls on discretionary spending across the company, and we have realized significant savings on travel, marketing events and professional fees. In addition, hiring and salary increases have been strictly limited to critical business needs and investment in our top performers. And in June, the executive leadership team and the board unanimously agreed to take six-month pay cuts ranging from 15% to 30%.
And as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a $15 million restructuring charge for actions that will generate annual run rate savings of approximately $30 million. Additional cost savings actions are anticipated in the current fiscal year. As an example, we are taking actions to rationalize our real estate portfolio given our successful transition to a virtual work environment. We will update you on our progress as the anticipated savings -- and the anticipated savings we will make throughout the year.
In summary, we are very well positioned to navigate the COVID-related challenges ahead while investing in key optimization and growth initiatives. As a reminder, given our limited visibility in the current economic environment, we have suspended our practice of providing annual guidance. We expect to return to providing guidance when the economic environment becomes more stable and our visibility improves. I'll now pass the call back to Brian.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. So, to recap the main messages for today, our business remains strong through the pandemic with good momentum continuing in both research and education services. We're experiencing COVID-related disruptions to print books and in-person training. Of course, this represents a smaller part of Wiley today, with nearly 80% of our revenue coming from digital products and tech-enabled services.
Core trends remain favorable in Wiley's key strategic areas of focus, such as peer-reviewed research, online education, digital content and courseware. We're taking full advantage of this unusual moment to drive improvement in the cost structure and core functioning of Wiley, focusing on high potential areas, such as our content development workflows, our management of the customer life cycle and the tuning of our real estate footprint for an increasingly virtual workforce. Overall, we're confident in the enduring importance of our Research and Education content, platforms and services. But more importantly, we're optimistic that this challenging moment -- at this challenging moment because we're seeing compelling evidence in our KPIs that our markets are strong and that our strategies are working.
To be specific, we're experiencing strong growth in demand to publish in our journals and consumer research, strong growth in Research platform signings, recurring revenue and content consumption with 98% client retention, strong growth in our digital courseware portfolio, strong growth in enrollment at our online degree programs and increased interest of universities in accelerating the transition to online education. So despite some near-term headwinds, the data tells me that we're tightly aligned with the current and long-term needs of our customers, the researchers, students, professors, administrators and corporate leaders that we serve worldwide. Once again, I want to thank our wonderful Wiley colleagues around the world for their grit, their positive spirit and their remarkable accomplishments this quarter. With that, I'll open the floor to your comments and questions.
Questions &amp; Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with research. Obviously, a really solid growth in a difficult environment.
How much of the jump in article output and content consumption would you contribute to COVID-related research? And as a follow-up, how much of the jump in research revenue and EBITDA reflects things like reprints and back files, open access? Just trying to get a sense for that relative to maybe the kind of legacy Research business, if you will.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start, and John can chip in. So, we're seeing -- definitely seeing good momentum in Research publishing. The COVID crisis has definitely increased the interest in -- or the output of researchers, and we see no signs of that declining.
With respect to specific COVID-related research, we certainly are publishing more COVID-related papers, as you would expect. But as a percentage of our total,  It's a very small percentage.  It's really a much broader --  It's a much broader increase in demand that we're seeing at this point in time that's coming across the portfolio. And to answer your second question, a large portion of that is coming in open access.
So, we're seeing really good growth rates in our open access pay-to-publish models, which, as you know, is a price times quantity model. So, when that happens, that translates directly into our revenue base. So we're definitely feeling consistent and increasing demand. And the practices that we've taken in the marketplace, which have been very market friendly, we believe, are leading researchers to choose Wiley and choose our journal.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Indeed. And on OA specifically, is it more article output from the same customers? More interest from new parties? How would you sort of weigh those two?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you know, in Open Access, the researchers themselves are deciding where to submit their articles. And as they do, they're choosing the titles, meaning the journal titles, and the publishers that they want to work with. So, increasingly,  It's almost a B2C model in that case. And so, things like the reputation, the quality of the customer experience, the researcher experience as they go through the publishing process, the speed with which the article gets out and the quality with which it gets promoted are what drives that.
So, we believe that we're seeing researchers choose us, quite simply stated. If that answers your question, Dan. If I didn't answer it specifically, please follow up.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
No, that helps. Absolutely. Maybe one or two quick follow-ups. The -- given the growth in OA, if we were to break down Research between kind of annual contracted revenue versus more variable or consumption-based, what would that look like at this stage percentage-wise?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, currently, as you look at our -- go ahead, John. Yes.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
I'll answer this in a way that is also responsive, Dan, to your question about what was the composition of revenue in the quarter. Roughly speaking, about 80% of our revenue comes from the combination of subscriptions and open access. And within that, call it, 70% of our research publishing business is subscription and about 10% of it is OA. The remaining 20% of our business, Dan, is, frankly, largely products and services that are derivatives of articles that are published under subscription, such as reprints that you mentioned and such as corporate advertising.
So, that's roughly the split of revenue that we have today. And of course, the subscription base is largely contracted, right? So that's well in play, but we're coming up on a renewal season. You asked whether -- you asked about are there significant backhaul revenues or such in the quarter, and the answer to that is no. This was a pretty normal quarter for us in terms of the composition of products and services that drove our revenue.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
That's helpful because that can be really high margin. One more, and I'll jump out. But you alluded, Brian, to obviously the extraordinary pressures that universities will be facing. Given where the stock is and has been trading, I think there's a lot more fear out there than -- well, may or may not warranted, we'll see.
But I know you don't want to get into the guidance, but when you think about Research, is there a range -- I guess, one, how are those initial dialogues going for calendar '21? And two, is there a range of revenue growth that you might be able to -- at an extreme high, extreme low bracket to sort of rein in some of the fears out there? Maybe  It's too early, but I thought I'd give you the opportunity.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah, look, I mean,  It's a completely fair question, and  It's what we want to know as well. We're talking to our customers very, very closely, and we're trying to get a sense of it. But  It's really early in the renewal season, and so it really is too early to tell.
We do expect some price pressure. But we expect that that price pressure should be offset by this strong growth that you're seeing in OA and in platforms and other areas. So, the simple answer is  It's too early to tell but that we believe that the price pressure we face will be modest and that it will be largely offset, if not more than offset, by our open access growth.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
OK. Helpful. I'll follow up with -- jump back in queue with any follow-up.
Operator
Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, Brian, historically, when GDP has fallen and unemployment has risen, enrollment trends have accelerated. And listening to your preamble, it doesn't sound like that's what you're seeing or anticipating for the fall semester, but just want to get more detail around that.
And then, on a related note, the 4% organic growth for Ed Services that you reported in the quarter, is that indicative of what we should anticipate for the balance of fiscal '21? And then, I have a follow-up.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Got it. So, from the perspective of the demand patterns in higher ed, this -- there's no question that there is a relationship between GDP, unemployment and college enrollment. That -- historically, that relationship has been one with a bit of a lag, a 12 to 18-month lag. And so, we do expect that to play out here, and we believe we're already seeing it in our leads, in our interest and in our enrollment.
But really, traditionally, that's played out over time. What's happening now in enrollment is different than that, though. What's happening now is literally a practical preclusion on universities from running schools as they normally had and a depression or a downward pressure on enrollment that's come from health fears related to being in large groups of people, as everybody knows. So, what we're seeing -- the enrollment pressure we're seeing is not some sort of an inverse relationship to the tradition.
In fact,  It's a novel pressure. And that novel pressure was expected in the fall to be in the neighborhood of 10 or 15%. We think it could be on the lower end of that. But from Wiley's perspective, and this is really important, from Wiley's perspective, our -- and that has -- that, by the way, will affect our principal sales.
But from Wiley's perspective, our strategic growth areas are digital courseware and online education, and those run counter to the trends that we're seeing in the market because if you can't go to school in person, you go online. Or if you're supposed to -- if you're usually in a classroom, but now you're going to be studying from home in a virtual environment, you have no choice but to get the digital materials. You can't share. You can't -- a book is not going to help because you need to be in the courseware.
So, that is contributing to an upswell in the parts of that business that we are strategically focused on in the future. So both in the services business, where we're focused on online enrollment, and in the courseware business or the content business, where we're focused on digital content and courseware, we actually believe that this is a material change that will have a long-term benefit for the business. Then answering second part of your question, we are seeing -- obviously, results are backward-looking. And in the spring, we definitely saw some shock to the system from COVID that affected enrollments.
It just -- this is not surprising. But over this summer, we started to see elevated levels of interest in our -- in lead generation and in conversion, leading to pretty good enrollment trend. So, our enrollment actually was up around 9% recently, and then we should see some of that continue. But again, we're just getting into the semester.
We'll just see exactly how this start goes. And so, we're not at all pessimistic. Quite the contrary, we're optimistic about where that business is going and the enrollment trends due to the things that I've been talking about, both the short-term shift to online translating into a greater acceptance of online learning and online education where it is really is the norm now in many cases for a large portion of people getting postsecondary educations, and then followed by what we expect to be a significant, economically driven increase in interest in education due to the inverse relationship that you identified before between the economy and enrollment in schools.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Got it. OK. Very helpful. And then, I know you spent a lot of time talking about open access, and it, obviously, had a very good quarter.
Just any updated thoughts around the sustainability of that growth? And then, separately, John, can you address the timing-related working capital issues that impacted your cash flow during the quarter?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll pick up the OA question first. We're -- long before COVID, we were seeing significantly greater volumes of submissions and consequent volumes of our output. That has continued and increase through COVID-19.
We see no reason to believe that  It's not going to continue. There might be a slight elevation now that's related to researchers being at home and finishing up papers. You think that would've been done already, and yet the elevated levels continue, and in fact, they're increasing. So, we're very bullish on those volumes levels continuing at a high level on a go-forward basis.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
And then, Drew, on your question with respect to cash flow and, in particular, the impact of working capital that I referenced in my comments, which were the biggest drivers. I mean, by the way, we had very strong performance in the quarter from a real earnings growth perspective, but then working capital played against us. And in particular, I would note that our cash collections associated with journals were pretty strong and in line with our expectations, so we're feeling good about collections there. We do have some customers that have requested extended terms, but  It's not a material impact to our results, and we feel like that's flowing well.
The most significant impact on the timing of working capital has to do with payables. In the March -- late March and April time frame, like others, we went into a bit of cash conservation mode given potential risks around liquidity in the market at that point in time. And so, we put some pressure on payables at that time. And then, as things began to ease up in our first quarter, we also eased up on payables.
So, the ground that we gave up on cash flow in the quarter is particularly concentrated around payables, and  It's just sort of the normal flow back to a balance after conserving cash at the end of the fourth quarter.

Our next question comes from Sami Kassab with Exane.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my questions, I have three of them, please. The first one is on a topic that I think you've just touched on, but I would kindly like you to perhaps elaborate a little bit more.
On open access, what's the risk that the elevated levels of submissions that we've seen actually reflect the fact that scientists have been locked down at home and away from their labs and had a lot of time to write papers but had no ability to make progress on their scientific research and that those three, four months will actually, six months, 12 months down the road, will lead to a slowdown in open access growth as science did not really happen through the lockdowns? Secondly, on China, we've seen the Chinese government communicate new research appraisal policies, pushing Chinese scientists to publish more into Chinese local language journals, [Inaudible] moving away from splicing. Do you think the China policy and regulatory changes may have an impact, or is that too small to matter? Is that not something that is big on your radar screen? Then lastly, can you elaborate a little bit on how you see the regulatory environment in OPM? We've had the likes of Bob Sherman and Senator Warren look at OPM. Do you think the regulatory environment could be at risk of changing? Or do you think  It's a solid regime that you have today and you have no major concerns on the regulatory front for OPM?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you very much for asking three questions, each of which is a dissertation. So, I'll take them one at a time. They're very good questions, excellent questions that I'd be asking if I were you. So the first one, on the risk of the elevated level of OA sort of bringing back to some lower level later, we are now six or more months into this pandemic; seven or eight, depending on where you're looking in the world.
We continue to see elevated levels. We continue to see researchers putting out papers. Researchers are going back into the labs, absolutely. And so, we're -- we expect it to continue at some level.
Could it come back a little bit? Of course, it could. We're at a very high level right now. But I will remind you that trends in research are very, very positive in terms of overall increasing volume of output in the marketplace. So, in other words, we see mid to high-single-digit increases in the volume of papers every year.
And that long preceded the environment. We consider that will continue in the future. The second thing is that the research continues to be something that is funded at a very high level. In countries around the world, we see no we see no signs of that declining.
So, yeah, I mean, there's no question that there could be a little bit of an artificial increase, but those artificial -- those increases have continued for quite some time now. The final thing I'd say on that is we believe that our publishing program and our approach to publishing is extremely researcher and market friendly, and we think we're getting more than our fair share of submissions. I'll also remind you that of all the submissions we get, we publish a very small portion of them, and so there's always increasing potential there. So, no, I don't see a snapback or a rebound that goes the wrong way on us in the future.
Now, the question of China, another really good question. China is a super important market in the future of research. China is a very important producer and consumer of research. China represents around 5% of our research publishing business now.
So, from a business perspective,  It's not going to swing us one way or the other in any given quarter, but it is very important in the long run, and we are -- and the increasing discussion in China about their endemic -- or indigenous publishing is certainly an important move and important trend. But we have very, very close relationships in China. We have a very good connection to the government agencies and so forth there, and we continue to stay very close to them. Chinese researchers want their journals to be in the best journals in the world so that they can get the recognition and the -- for their work that they desire, and we believe our publishing portfolio leads us there.
But also, we are increasingly partnering in China to make sure that we are seen as the publisher of choice. So, while there is some -- there's always some concern when there are discussions going on in places like China about changes in policy, we believe that, ultimately, we're very well positioned to capitalize on what is still continuing significant growth in both Chinese publishing and Chinese consumption. On the --
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Sorry, may I squeeze in a follow-up before we move to OPM? In subscription unbundling and sub has seen some strong takeup, a third of R1 universities on unsub within less than a year. Do you see a trend or risk toward more unbundling of the big deals, especially in the U.S. as universities face budgetary pressure?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So, if the question is about unbundling and whether we are seeing more or we'll be seeing more, as universities face pressure, they certainly are looking for ways to save cost. I've said we can't really comment on what we expect that pricing pressure to be. But as we look into the market, we don't see a lot of evidence.
We see some one-off cases, but we don't see a lot of evidence of universities and university librarians saying we don't need that content, our researchers don't need it, we're not using it. So, to the extent that we have a high -- which we do, a very high-quality portfolio of journals that is essential to the success of research, we will continue to be purchased by those universities. I'll remind you that academics make their careers based upon research, and universities climb the rankings or to descend in the rankings based upon their positioning in the research ecosystem and both the volume and the quality of their output. So, research and research content is absolutely central to the success of our important clients.
So, while we may see some edge cases because, to be sure, there's pressure in the marketplace, we don't see any sort of any evidence of a large-scale trend toward unbundling. OK. And let me move toward OPM. So, the conversation about OPM has gone on for a long time, and the conversation about the revenue share model has gone on for a long period of time.
We start from the position that we have excellent relationships, long-term relationships with our universities, and we help those universities fundamentally to succeed. We help them to succeed by providing extremely high-quality programs, by attracting students and by matriculating those students at extremely high completion rates, higher completion rates than typically they see in their on-ground programs. So, insofar as we are doing that, we are helping those universities to succeed. There has long been a conversation about the revenue share model.
Our clients seem to be fine with it. Now, to be sure, there will be some movement in the marketplace there, and therefore, Wiley has adopted again, as we always do, very market friendly practices of working with universities on terms that they believe are fair. And we have our bundled revenue share model businesses, we have our fee-for-service businesses and so forth. So, we believe wherever the market goes, we're going to be fine.
Having said that, we participate very closely in the discussions that go on in Washington and elsewhere on the future of education, generally speaking, and on the future of of higher ed and its relationship with service providers. So, we've responded to the various inquiries. They have been ongoing. We expect them to continue to be ongoing.
But we're very close to it, and we are not -- our confidence in the future is based upon the fact that we're in a consensual relationship, if you call it, with our partners, who are getting a tremendous amount out of it. If we, together, or if they decide they want to go in a different direction, we're very happy to go in a different direction with them, and we always have been. So we don't view it as a major threat.  It's something to be talked about,  It's something to be studied,  It's something to be adapted to.
But we are confident in our position and, more importantly, the position and the quality of the services and the value of the services that we provide to the marketplace.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
This is fantastic and all very convincing. You said in your opening remarks that you had higher completion rates. Did you mean that your OPM program has higher completion rate than equivalent on-campus programs have?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Typically speaking, our programs -- I will say, our programs have very high completion rates for the students that start and those that complete the program. I'll remind you that, historically, when the industry has come under pressure, it has been for universities and education providers that have had extremely low completion rates, such that students started but they never finished and, therefore, never got value for the education that they paid for or that somebody else, such as the government or the taxpayer, paid for. That is absolutely not the case in our programs. The completion rates are extremely high, and our clients are happy with them.
And, clearly, students are happy with them because they're staying through to completion and achieving career outcomes that perpetuate the demand for the product.

Our next question comes from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen. Prior to COVID, rearing its ugly head, margins were eroding. Was that from your conversion from hard copy to digital, or did it relate to state cutbacks in education?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
John, do you want to pick that up?
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, just generally, looking back over fiscal year '20, we did see some erosion of our margin. I would say that the most significant drivers behind that erosion of margin were two. One was the rapid -- continued rapid decline of print, which has reasonably good margins.
But print, as we know, is in decline, and that rate of decline got a bit faster in the past fiscal year and had an impact on our bottom line. We're taking actions, as we discussed in today's review, to improve the profitability of that business by focusing and by, in particular, focusing our future on digital courseware and digital content. The second factor that contributed overall to the shift in the blended margin of the business, there's an increased component of our revenue coming from OPM business that we just talked about. And we recognize that in its current state, the market itself in its current state that operating margins are low.
But we've been emphasizing that we are balancing between top line growth, which is very important to us, and improving profitability there. And we said that we would drive that business to 15% EBITDA margin by next year, and we're well on the march to get there. But those are the two factors that have been putting pressure on our margin, and both of them are being addressed.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
If going forward, there are continued high levels of unemployment, is that a tailwind in that there's a tendency for enrollments in school to go up in that kind of macroeconomic environment?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I'll pick that back up, John. As I was indicating earlier, there is a long term -- and in fact, I think it was either Dan or Drew that pointed it out, there is a long-term established pattern of when the economy goes down and unemployment goes up, that people go back to school. That relationship is typically a lagged relationship, meaning it happens not instantly, it happens 12 to 18 months later, and we do expect to see that.
But we have other tailwinds that are hitting us right now, which is simply that people can't go to school in person. They're physically precluded from going to school fully in person. And so, therefore, we have elevated levels of interest from potential students in taking education in an online world. It also is providing a tailwind, as I indicated earlier, to our digital courseware businesses, which, as I indicated in my remarks, are seeing record increases in usage and adoption because again, if you're not in a physical setting, you need a learning management system based product, something that -- where your teacher can make assignments, where you can do homework, where you can get the content predictably, the content that the teacher needs, not have to Google for your curriculum.
And physical books just aren't as good in those environments. They don't do all those things. And so, there's a significant tailwind that hits you in that sense. And, again, as I indicated, the -- we believe that these are accelerations of long-term trends so that it won't be a short-term blip.
We believe that we're going to see continued elevation of those levels, which is completely -- all of these trends that I'm talking about are completely in sync and aligned with our strategy that we've been working on for the last few years. And  It's gratifying to see it start to come to fruition at a time when the world needs both education and research more than ever.

373,kj@mentedcosmetics.com,"With $4 billion in sales in 12 months and a rosy forecast ahead, lipstick manufacturers were smiling at the end of 2019, and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing face masks and an unstable economy. With no end to the crisis in sight, brands large and small have had to adjust manufacturing, advertising, and social media on the fly. The results, they say, are paying off — and may mark the beginning of profound changes for the cosmetics industry.
Beyond changes in everyday demand for lip color, some businesses have found themselves re-examining everything from their supply chain up. E.L.F. Beauty, a mass-market brand founded in 2004, reacted to the pandemic earlier than most, according to Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer, because it sources its products abroad. It made changes in early January — weeks before Western countries entered lockdown — when its operation in China was impacted. It has managed to adjust and keep customers supplied, but has noticed a shift in what people are buying. 
Lipstick has slid, most likely because people cared less about the colors of their lips when they're all having to wear masks and the economic fallout of lockdown, but sales of other items rose to pick up the slack.
""We saw a surge in the market around bronzer and brow, so we swiftly deployed assets and messaging to accelerate E.L.F. bronzers and brow products,"" Marchisotto says. ""As we continue navigating through COVID-19, we closely monitor consumer signals and learn that they don't just change monthly or weekly during this crisis. They can change daily or even hourly.""
These shifts are happening across the industry. A May report from McKinsey, the consultancy giant, found cosmetics sales had dropped 55% among prestige brands. ""When consumers do return to work, many will continue to wear masks, further slowing makeup's recovery,"" the report said. However, the report noted that sales of skin-, nail- and hair-care products in Europe had quadrupled, as more people pampered themselves at home — and a September report from market research firm NPD found that more women in the US were using facial skincare products than in 2019.
This constant adjustment has been particularly challenging for independent brands, which may not have the cash or infrastructure to absorb huge drops in sales or swings in their inventory. For Mented, a growing, Black-owned brand with a dedicated following for its highly-pigmented color cosmetics, the pandemic has proved challenging — but surprising, in a good way.
Cofounder Amanda E. Johnson says: ""We were planning on having a great 2020 and then March hit. It was slow in the beginning for everybody, because COVID shook the world and no one knew what was going on. So, we thought, 'oh, we're going to have a horrible year like everyone else.'""
The company adjusted its forecast down 40% and braced for disaster, but was shocked when April's sales figures came in. ""We were like, ""Oh my God, this is the biggest month in the history of the company. It must be an anomaly."" It wasn't. Sales are actually trending up and projections have been readjusted.
Amanda E. Johnson, cofounder and COO of Mented Cosmetics.
Mented Cosmetics
Johnson says the fact the business has always been online only helped — as did its focus on people of color. She also believes that lipstick, despite rising mask-wearing, is finding its place in the pandemic with two very different kinds of consumers. ""One, there's the professional that's working from home. So, if she is working from home, she's on Zoom and Team and Google Hangout calls all day long"" and secondly, ""the essential worker. So, we've asked, why are you still putting on lipstick every day? And what we've heard back is, because 'I need something to make me feel good right now.'""
Marchisotto agrees, predicting the business will keep promoting beauty as an important element of self-care in a difficult time. One nurse wrote to the company saying its primer had changed her life — this kind of direct feedback is important at a time when all historical models of trends are obsolete. ""It was another moment for us to understand the power of our products. We don't just sell beauty."" 
While the path forward is still unclear, Johnson is beginning to think that marketing products as an indulgence could prove successful. ""Women are definitely still buying makeup in droves,"" she says, but adds that the difference is ""they want brands to tell them that they're doing the right thing.""
It remains to be seen which platforms are best for telling buyers that. TikTok, Home Shopping Network, and Instagram have all shown good results for these brands. The message is clearly one consumers want to hear. ""Historically, color cosmetics has been a 'recession-proof product,'"" Johnson said. ""And I think what we're seeing is, in some ways, it is also pandemic proof.""","I just read that Mented Cosmetics had a rosy forecast ahead of 2019  and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit  bringing face masks and an unstable economy. Undoubtedly  cosmetics sales had dropped 55% among prestige brands. But sales of skin-  nail- and hair-care products in Europe had quadrupled  as more people pampered themselves at home. Did you notice the same trend in the U.S?",

John Wiley &amp; Sons (A Shares) (NYSE:JW-A)Q1 2021 Earnings CallSep 03, 2020, 10:00 a.m. ET

<ul><li>Prepared Remarks</li><li>Questions and Answers</li><li>Call Participants</li></ul>Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Wiley's vice president of investor relations, Brian Campbell. Please go ahead.
Brian Campbell -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter 2021 earnings update. On the call with me are Brian Napack, president and chief executive officer; and John Kritzmacher, chief financial officer. A few reminders to start.
The call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. You shouldn't rely on these statements, as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our SEC filings. The company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Wiley provides non-GAAP measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends.
These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under GAAP. Please see the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures presented in the supplementary information included in our press release. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency, unless otherwise specified.
After the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. I'll now turn the call over to Wiley's president and CEO, Brian Napack. 
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Right now, educators and students around the world are heading back to school and researchers are heading back into their labs in a world significantly altered by COVID-19. As they do, they're rewriting the playbooks for education and research. From our vantage point,  It's clear that they're turning to digital content, platforms and services at unprecedented levels, and they're also turning to corporate partners, such as Wiley, who can help them achieve their goals in a changed world.
The result for Wiley is that across the company, demand for our digital products and services has grown markedly. This unusual moment is moving our markets and proving that the strategies that we have been pursuing are not only right for the market today, they are right for where the market is going in the long term. We had a solid first quarter of revenue and earnings performance despite the disrupted environment. This demonstrated both resilience of our business and tight alignment of our strategies with the market's evolving needs.
We'll talk specifics about our performance shortly, but  It's important to note that today's acute health, economic and social problems serve to reinforce the value of Wiley's mission. Over the past months, we've moved faster to validate and publish more research and have made thousands of critical COVID-related research studies freely available. We've helped many universities, schools and corporations around the world to more quickly migrate from traditional to virtual learning. And we spent lots of time in our communities, raised money for causes that address injustice and taking concrete actions to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion within Wiley.
We continue to be reminded of the racial inequality plaguing our society and the need for corporate citizens, such as us, to play an active role in dismantling it. Our global team takes great pride in the fact that their work is truly helping the world to heal, recover, and thrive. Wiley today remains largely in work-from-home mode, although we have partially opened a few offices around the world where local health conditions allow. I want to recognize the great work of our team in executing at a very high level through this challenging period.
Simply stated, the team continues to deliver on our key milestones and customer commitments. In regular surveys, the vast majority of our colleagues report feeling productive and happy, and their engagement is very high. This can be attributed to our strong mission-driven culture, our tech-enabled workflows and our consistent emphasis on colleague care. The pandemic continues to disrupt the global economy, and this has directly impacted some of our more traditional revenue sources, such as physical books and in person training.
But despite these focused headwinds, we're very encouraged by the underlying momentum we're seeing in education and research. This momentum should continue well beyond the pandemic. We've been talking for some time about the positive trends that are driving research and education. Our growth strategy is built on these trends.
I'm pleased to see that they are accelerating at this moment and that Wiley is capitalizing on them. Research output is rising rapidly. Demand for online education and for the digital courseware to support it is also rising rapidly. The acceleration in these areas speaks well to our long-term outlook.
Internally, we are using the moment to lean into our operational excellence. This includes a focus on improving content workflows, our customer journeys our facilities' footprint and more. John will talk about this later, but there is much we have done and much that we continue to do to improve the efficiency of operations. With that, let me summarize the first quarter's results.
As I said, we continue to see COVID-related disruption to printed books and in-person training in the quarter. Offsetting that was strong growth in key strategic areas, including Open Access publishing, research content usage, online student enrollment and digital courseware. The net result was that revenue rose 2%, adjusted EPS rose 124%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 42%. Organic revenue was down 1%.
I'll provide more detail on all of this in our segment discussions. The material earnings improvement this quarter was primarily driven by favorable revenue performance, particularly in Research, lower discretionary spending and savings from restructuring. Corporate expenses alone were down 16% or $7 million. Let's take a look at the segments.
Our research business continues to perform well. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA rose 6 and 19%, respectively. An important note is that about 4 million of our Q1 revenue came from journal subscription renewals that were delayed from Q4 due to COVID-19. That said, our strategies across the Research business continue to bear fruit.
Article output was up 13%. As you know, this is a key driver of our business models.  It's an outcome of good market growth, our strong publishing programs and our market-friendly publishing strategies. We continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth from our open access publishing program.
Our comprehensive national agreements in Europe are performing well with publishing volumes exceeding our expectations. Usage of the Wiley online library is growing strongly, up 10% over prior year. Our industry-leading society publishing program is having another great year. Net society wins will result in around $11 million of incremental publishing revenue in calendar '21.
In June, we signed a 10-year extension of our important Cochrane Library partnership. For reference, Cochrane is the world's preeminent collection of validated evidence for healthcare decision-makers. Our platform revenue rose 10% on new customer launches for Literatum. We continue to consolidate Literatum's industry-leading position in research content distribution, and our customer retention on a trailing 12-month basis was 98%.
Finally, we expanded our partnership with AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is one of the world's largest scientific societies. As part of this, we'll move the full suite of content from science, a globally celebrated family of journals, onto Literatum. This follows our recent announcement that we have also partnered with AAAS to grow their science career center.
I'll provide a bit of forward-looking color for each of our three segments. In research, our strong market position and diversified revenue streams are providing a solid foundation through this time of change. Calendar '20 subscription agreements are locked in through December of this year, and our calendar '21 renewal season just recently started. We do anticipate that COVID-related budget constraints at libraries will result in some price pressure for '21, but  It's too early to quantify.
In any case, we expect to offset this pressure through the continued strong growth of open access, research platforms and corporate solutions. At the same time, we continue to enhance our end-to-end workflows to improve efficiency and enhance the value proposition for researchers. We've made very good progress already, as evidenced in our strong EBITDA performance, reduced publishing cycle times and improved researcher engagement. In summary, we're seeing strong underlying indicators of future growth and long-term customer health.
In academic and professional learning, or APL, the story is an interesting one. The quarter was significantly affected by COVID due to the closure of bookstores, testing centers and corporate offices. Naturally, this affected the more traditional areas of APL, such as print book publishing, Test Prep services and in-person corporate training. The effect was that APL revenue declined 12, 13% organically, and adjusted EBITDA declined 23%.
But despite this short-term pressure, there's good news for the future in our KPIs. We're seeing quite positive trends in digital content and courseware as universities and companies pivot to virtual learning. We appear to be in an inflection point for digital content and digital courseware with record growth of 32 and 88%, respectively, on a pro forma basis. Our strategy to focus tightly on high-demand skills and careers is paying off.
In higher ed, we are gaining market share. Our share has grown from 4% in July 2018 to nearly 5% in July 2020 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our innovative zyBooks and Alta digital offerings are winning adoptions at an impressive pace. For example, zyBooks, our STEM platform, saw revenue double over the prior year, and it is winning consistently in large course adoptions.
So actually, I'm feeling good about the future of APL despite this quarter's COVID-19-related declines in our traditional business lines. For the remainder of the year, we expect that current trends will continue, namely that print book sales will continue to be challenged by COVID lockdowns and virtual learning. Note that print books represent a smaller portion of Wiley's overall business. Digital content and courseware will continue to grow strongly, helping to mitigate any potential decline this fall in higher ed enrollment.
Recovery in test prep will be dependent upon the reopening of testing sites and the resumption of certification exams. In corporate learning, we're seeing an acceleration of our virtual and hybrid corporate training products. We anticipate a strong post-pandemic recovery based upon what we are seeing in platform usage and new partner signings. Throughout APL, we're moving quickly to take advantage of the abrupt shift to digital learning by investing in our platforms and our go-to-market strategies.
This includes our value-driven business models that make content affordable. An example is our Inclusive Access program, which continues to grow very strongly. We are also responding to the moment by publishing timely titles on topics such as running businesses virtually and creating diverse, inclusive and equitable cultures. Finally, we're driving rapid and significant improvement in our cost structure to improve efficiency and our margin profile.
Our education services segment is positioned very well for this moment as universities, students and professionals are pivoting hard to both digital learning and online degrees. It will take time to fully realize the potential of this shift, but interest in our services, which help universities to succeed with online education, is running very high. For the quarter, revenue was up 29%, or 4% organically, and our EBITDA margin was 13%, which is up 9% for fiscal '20. Revenue growth was driven by $12 million of inorganic contribution from M3, as well as 9% growth in student enrollment.
Our mature and new programs are performing well, although organic growth was offset by small partner terminations as part of our continuous portfolio optimization. Our full-service partner count now stands at 67. We added two new full-service university partners in the quarter, the University of New Haven in Connecticut and Carlow University in Pennsylvania, and we signed additional universities for unbundled service agreements. Online program enrollment was very healthy this summer and remains so as we enter the fall semester.
At M3, we found the corporate demand for trained IT talent to be more stable in the pandemic than we had expected. Our existing customer base is solid, and we've begun placing new talent at several recently signed customers. Notably, we're gaining momentum in India where we are currently staffing a major new technology center for one of our global financial services clients. University services are facing significant pressures this year.
Universities are facing significant pressures this year as they simultaneously shift to hybrid and virtual learning while also dealing with financial shortfalls brought on by COVID-related enrollment declines. Although intermediate and long-term trends are very good, there is some near-term uncertainty to manage through with our clients. As with digital courseware, online education is now past the inflection point and is broadly adopted and accepted as a mainstream way to get a degree or certification. This was true before COVID, but the disruption of the past six months has driven home the value of high-quality, fairly priced education that can fit the life and career needs of the broad public.
This moment is reflected in enrollment trends and good pipeline of potential university partnerships, both in the U.S. and abroad and with our key partners, most of whom are evaluating online expansion opportunities. M3's IT talent placement volume is anticipated to be steady for the balance of the year as our corporate partners continue to maintain and grow their tech talent capacity. Major operational focus within education service is the continued improvement of the student journey from lead to enrollment.
These efforts continue to bear fruit in higher conversion rates and lower student acquisition costs. The business is well on track to realize its fiscal '22 goal of the 15% EBITDA margin. I'll now pass the call over to John to take you through our financial profile and optimization initiatives.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Brian. Despite a very challenging environment, we are generally pleased with our revenue and earnings performance for this quarter. That said, our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were unfavorable to prior year by $27 million and $20 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of changes in working capital. As a reminder, our cash flow is normally the use of cash in the first half of our fiscal year due to timing of collection for general subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
Capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, declined $6 million to $24 million for the quarter. As discussed on the last earnings call, we expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, with investment focused on new product and service capabilities, as well as process redesign and workflow automation. With respect to investment in acquisitions, we will remain opportunistic and continue our pursuit of attractive opportunities to add scale and provide enhanced tech-enabled products and services in both research and online education. In terms of our balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was up $117 million primarily due to acquisitions, but our interest expense was lower by $1.5 million as we realized the benefit of the lower interest rate environment.
Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.0 times, inclusive of all acquisitions. In terms of access to capital, we reported $101 million of cash on hand, and we ended the quarter with undrawn revolving credit of $650 million. Our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity afford us the flexibility to continue investing, acquiring and returning cash to shareholders. In June, the company modestly increased its quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.
Our current dividend yield is more than 4%. As a reminder, due to the economic downturn, we have refrained from repurchasing shares. We remain fully confident in our continued strategic momentum, cash generation and liquidity position, and we expect to resume share repurchases as the economic environment recovers. We are moving quickly on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the economic downturn and improve our agility and efficiency.
These programs are companywide and include optimizing our content development workflows, streamlining our customer support operations and achieving benchmark efficiency levels for corporate support functions, such as HR and finance. Meanwhile, we continue to maintain tight controls on discretionary spending across the company, and we have realized significant savings on travel, marketing events and professional fees. In addition, hiring and salary increases have been strictly limited to critical business needs and investment in our top performers. And in June, the executive leadership team and the board unanimously agreed to take six-month pay cuts ranging from 15% to 30%.
And as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a $15 million restructuring charge for actions that will generate annual run rate savings of approximately $30 million. Additional cost savings actions are anticipated in the current fiscal year. As an example, we are taking actions to rationalize our real estate portfolio given our successful transition to a virtual work environment. We will update you on our progress as the anticipated savings -- and the anticipated savings we will make throughout the year.
In summary, we are very well positioned to navigate the COVID-related challenges ahead while investing in key optimization and growth initiatives. As a reminder, given our limited visibility in the current economic environment, we have suspended our practice of providing annual guidance. We expect to return to providing guidance when the economic environment becomes more stable and our visibility improves. I'll now pass the call back to Brian.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. So, to recap the main messages for today, our business remains strong through the pandemic with good momentum continuing in both research and education services. We're experiencing COVID-related disruptions to print books and in-person training. Of course, this represents a smaller part of Wiley today, with nearly 80% of our revenue coming from digital products and tech-enabled services.
Core trends remain favorable in Wiley's key strategic areas of focus, such as peer-reviewed research, online education, digital content and courseware. We're taking full advantage of this unusual moment to drive improvement in the cost structure and core functioning of Wiley, focusing on high potential areas, such as our content development workflows, our management of the customer life cycle and the tuning of our real estate footprint for an increasingly virtual workforce. Overall, we're confident in the enduring importance of our Research and Education content, platforms and services. But more importantly, we're optimistic that this challenging moment -- at this challenging moment because we're seeing compelling evidence in our KPIs that our markets are strong and that our strategies are working.
To be specific, we're experiencing strong growth in demand to publish in our journals and consumer research, strong growth in Research platform signings, recurring revenue and content consumption with 98% client retention, strong growth in our digital courseware portfolio, strong growth in enrollment at our online degree programs and increased interest of universities in accelerating the transition to online education. So despite some near-term headwinds, the data tells me that we're tightly aligned with the current and long-term needs of our customers, the researchers, students, professors, administrators and corporate leaders that we serve worldwide. Once again, I want to thank our wonderful Wiley colleagues around the world for their grit, their positive spirit and their remarkable accomplishments this quarter. With that, I'll open the floor to your comments and questions.
Questions &amp; Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with research. Obviously, a really solid growth in a difficult environment.
How much of the jump in article output and content consumption would you contribute to COVID-related research? And as a follow-up, how much of the jump in research revenue and EBITDA reflects things like reprints and back files, open access? Just trying to get a sense for that relative to maybe the kind of legacy Research business, if you will.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start, and John can chip in. So, we're seeing -- definitely seeing good momentum in Research publishing. The COVID crisis has definitely increased the interest in -- or the output of researchers, and we see no signs of that declining.
With respect to specific COVID-related research, we certainly are publishing more COVID-related papers, as you would expect. But as a percentage of our total,  It's a very small percentage.  It's really a much broader --  It's a much broader increase in demand that we're seeing at this point in time that's coming across the portfolio. And to answer your second question, a large portion of that is coming in open access.
So, we're seeing really good growth rates in our open access pay-to-publish models, which, as you know, is a price times quantity model. So, when that happens, that translates directly into our revenue base. So we're definitely feeling consistent and increasing demand. And the practices that we've taken in the marketplace, which have been very market friendly, we believe, are leading researchers to choose Wiley and choose our journal.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Indeed. And on OA specifically, is it more article output from the same customers? More interest from new parties? How would you sort of weigh those two?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you know, in Open Access, the researchers themselves are deciding where to submit their articles. And as they do, they're choosing the titles, meaning the journal titles, and the publishers that they want to work with. So, increasingly,  It's almost a B2C model in that case. And so, things like the reputation, the quality of the customer experience, the researcher experience as they go through the publishing process, the speed with which the article gets out and the quality with which it gets promoted are what drives that.
So, we believe that we're seeing researchers choose us, quite simply stated. If that answers your question, Dan. If I didn't answer it specifically, please follow up.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
No, that helps. Absolutely. Maybe one or two quick follow-ups. The -- given the growth in OA, if we were to break down Research between kind of annual contracted revenue versus more variable or consumption-based, what would that look like at this stage percentage-wise?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, currently, as you look at our -- go ahead, John. Yes.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
I'll answer this in a way that is also responsive, Dan, to your question about what was the composition of revenue in the quarter. Roughly speaking, about 80% of our revenue comes from the combination of subscriptions and open access. And within that, call it, 70% of our research publishing business is subscription and about 10% of it is OA. The remaining 20% of our business, Dan, is, frankly, largely products and services that are derivatives of articles that are published under subscription, such as reprints that you mentioned and such as corporate advertising.
So, that's roughly the split of revenue that we have today. And of course, the subscription base is largely contracted, right? So that's well in play, but we're coming up on a renewal season. You asked whether -- you asked about are there significant backhaul revenues or such in the quarter, and the answer to that is no. This was a pretty normal quarter for us in terms of the composition of products and services that drove our revenue.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
That's helpful because that can be really high margin. One more, and I'll jump out. But you alluded, Brian, to obviously the extraordinary pressures that universities will be facing. Given where the stock is and has been trading, I think there's a lot more fear out there than -- well, may or may not warranted, we'll see.
But I know you don't want to get into the guidance, but when you think about Research, is there a range -- I guess, one, how are those initial dialogues going for calendar '21? And two, is there a range of revenue growth that you might be able to -- at an extreme high, extreme low bracket to sort of rein in some of the fears out there? Maybe  It's too early, but I thought I'd give you the opportunity.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah, look, I mean,  It's a completely fair question, and  It's what we want to know as well. We're talking to our customers very, very closely, and we're trying to get a sense of it. But  It's really early in the renewal season, and so it really is too early to tell.
We do expect some price pressure. But we expect that that price pressure should be offset by this strong growth that you're seeing in OA and in platforms and other areas. So, the simple answer is  It's too early to tell but that we believe that the price pressure we face will be modest and that it will be largely offset, if not more than offset, by our open access growth.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
OK. Helpful. I'll follow up with -- jump back in queue with any follow-up.

Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, Brian, historically, when GDP has fallen and unemployment has risen, enrollment trends have accelerated. And listening to your preamble, it doesn't sound like that's what you're seeing or anticipating for the fall semester, but just want to get more detail around that.
And then, on a related note, the 4% organic growth for Ed Services that you reported in the quarter, is that indicative of what we should anticipate for the balance of fiscal '21? And then, I have a follow-up.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Got it. So, from the perspective of the demand patterns in higher ed, this -- there's no question that there is a relationship between GDP, unemployment and college enrollment. That -- historically, that relationship has been one with a bit of a lag, a 12 to 18-month lag. And so, we do expect that to play out here, and we believe we're already seeing it in our leads, in our interest and in our enrollment.
But really, traditionally, that's played out over time. What's happening now in enrollment is different than that, though. What's happening now is literally a practical preclusion on universities from running schools as they normally had and a depression or a downward pressure on enrollment that's come from health fears related to being in large groups of people, as everybody knows. So, what we're seeing -- the enrollment pressure we're seeing is not some sort of an inverse relationship to the tradition.
In fact,  It's a novel pressure. And that novel pressure was expected in the fall to be in the neighborhood of 10 or 15%. We think it could be on the lower end of that. But from Wiley's perspective, and this is really important, from Wiley's perspective, our -- and that has -- that, by the way, will affect our principal sales.
But from Wiley's perspective, our strategic growth areas are digital courseware and online education, and those run counter to the trends that we're seeing in the market because if you can't go to school in person, you go online. Or if you're supposed to -- if you're usually in a classroom, but now you're going to be studying from home in a virtual environment, you have no choice but to get the digital materials. You can't share. You can't -- a book is not going to help because you need to be in the courseware.
So, that is contributing to an upswell in the parts of that business that we are strategically focused on in the future. So both in the services business, where we're focused on online enrollment, and in the courseware business or the content business, where we're focused on digital content and courseware, we actually believe that this is a material change that will have a long-term benefit for the business. Then answering second part of your question, we are seeing -- obviously, results are backward-looking. And in the spring, we definitely saw some shock to the system from COVID that affected enrollments.
It just -- this is not surprising. But over this summer, we started to see elevated levels of interest in our -- in lead generation and in conversion, leading to pretty good enrollment trend. So, our enrollment actually was up around 9% recently, and then we should see some of that continue. But again, we're just getting into the semester.
We'll just see exactly how this start goes. And so, we're not at all pessimistic. Quite the contrary, we're optimistic about where that business is going and the enrollment trends due to the things that I've been talking about, both the short-term shift to online translating into a greater acceptance of online learning and online education where it is really is the norm now in many cases for a large portion of people getting postsecondary educations, and then followed by what we expect to be a significant, economically driven increase in interest in education due to the inverse relationship that you identified before between the economy and enrollment in schools.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Got it. OK. Very helpful. And then, I know you spent a lot of time talking about open access, and it, obviously, had a very good quarter.
Just any updated thoughts around the sustainability of that growth? And then, separately, John, can you address the timing-related working capital issues that impacted your cash flow during the quarter?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll pick up the OA question first. We're -- long before COVID, we were seeing significantly greater volumes of submissions and consequent volumes of our output. That has continued and increase through COVID-19.
We see no reason to believe that  It's not going to continue. There might be a slight elevation now that's related to researchers being at home and finishing up papers. You think that would've been done already, and yet the elevated levels continue, and in fact, they're increasing. So, we're very bullish on those volumes levels continuing at a high level on a go-forward basis.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
And then, Drew, on your question with respect to cash flow and, in particular, the impact of working capital that I referenced in my comments, which were the biggest drivers. I mean, by the way, we had very strong performance in the quarter from a real earnings growth perspective, but then working capital played against us. And in particular, I would note that our cash collections associated with journals were pretty strong and in line with our expectations, so we're feeling good about collections there. We do have some customers that have requested extended terms, but  It's not a material impact to our results, and we feel like that's flowing well.
The most significant impact on the timing of working capital has to do with payables. In the March -- late March and April time frame, like others, we went into a bit of cash conservation mode given potential risks around liquidity in the market at that point in time. And so, we put some pressure on payables at that time. And then, as things began to ease up in our first quarter, we also eased up on payables.
So, the ground that we gave up on cash flow in the quarter is particularly concentrated around payables, and  It's just sort of the normal flow back to a balance after conserving cash at the end of the fourth quarter.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
OK. All right guys appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Sami Kassab with Exane.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my questions, I have three of them, please. The first one is on a topic that I think you've just touched on, but I would kindly like you to perhaps elaborate a little bit more.
On open access, what's the risk that the elevated levels of submissions that we've seen actually reflect the fact that scientists have been locked down at home and away from their labs and had a lot of time to write papers but had no ability to make progress on their scientific research and that those three, four months will actually, six months, 12 months down the road, will lead to a slowdown in open access growth as science did not really happen through the lockdowns? Secondly, on China, we've seen the Chinese government communicate new research appraisal policies, pushing Chinese scientists to publish more into Chinese local language journals, [Inaudible] moving away from splicing. Do you think the China policy and regulatory changes may have an impact, or is that too small to matter? Is that not something that is big on your radar screen? Then lastly, can you elaborate a little bit on how you see the regulatory environment in OPM? We've had the likes of Bob Sherman and Senator Warren look at OPM. Do you think the regulatory environment could be at risk of changing? Or do you think  It's a solid regime that you have today and you have no major concerns on the regulatory front for OPM?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you very much for asking three questions, each of which is a dissertation. So, I'll take them one at a time. They're very good questions, excellent questions that I'd be asking if I were you. So the first one, on the risk of the elevated level of OA sort of bringing back to some lower level later, we are now six or more months into this pandemic; seven or eight, depending on where you're looking in the world.
We continue to see elevated levels. We continue to see researchers putting out papers. Researchers are going back into the labs, absolutely. And so, we're -- we expect it to continue at some level.
Could it come back a little bit? Of course, it could. We're at a very high level right now. But I will remind you that trends in research are very, very positive in terms of overall increasing volume of output in the marketplace. So, in other words, we see mid to high-single-digit increases in the volume of papers every year.
And that long preceded the environment. We consider that will continue in the future. The second thing is that the research continues to be something that is funded at a very high level. In countries around the world, we see no we see no signs of that declining.
So, yeah, I mean, there's no question that there could be a little bit of an artificial increase, but those artificial -- those increases have continued for quite some time now. The final thing I'd say on that is we believe that our publishing program and our approach to publishing is extremely researcher and market friendly, and we think we're getting more than our fair share of submissions. I'll also remind you that of all the submissions we get, we publish a very small portion of them, and so there's always increasing potential there. So, no, I don't see a snapback or a rebound that goes the wrong way on us in the future.
Now, the question of China, another really good question. China is a super important market in the future of research. China is a very important producer and consumer of research. China represents around 5% of our research publishing business now.
So, from a business perspective,  It's not going to swing us one way or the other in any given quarter, but it is very important in the long run, and we are -- and the increasing discussion in China about their endemic -- or indigenous publishing is certainly an important move and important trend. But we have very, very close relationships in China. We have a very good connection to the government agencies and so forth there, and we continue to stay very close to them. Chinese researchers want their journals to be in the best journals in the world so that they can get the recognition and the -- for their work that they desire, and we believe our publishing portfolio leads us there.
But also, we are increasingly partnering in China to make sure that we are seen as the publisher of choice. So, while there is some -- there's always some concern when there are discussions going on in places like China about changes in policy, we believe that, ultimately, we're very well positioned to capitalize on what is still continuing significant growth in both Chinese publishing and Chinese consumption. On the --
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Sorry, may I squeeze in a follow-up before we move to OPM? In subscription unbundling and sub has seen some strong takeup, a third of R1 universities on unsub within less than a year. Do you see a trend or risk toward more unbundling of the big deals, especially in the U.S. as universities face budgetary pressure?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So, if the question is about unbundling and whether we are seeing more or we'll be seeing more, as universities face pressure, they certainly are looking for ways to save cost. I've said we can't really comment on what we expect that pricing pressure to be. But as we look into the market, we don't see a lot of evidence.
We see some one-off cases, but we don't see a lot of evidence of universities and university librarians saying we don't need that content, our researchers don't need it, we're not using it. So, to the extent that we have a high -- which we do, a very high-quality portfolio of journals that is essential to the success of research, we will continue to be purchased by those universities. I'll remind you that academics make their careers based upon research, and universities climb the rankings or to descend in the rankings based upon their positioning in the research ecosystem and both the volume and the quality of their output. So, research and research content is absolutely central to the success of our important clients.
So, while we may see some edge cases because, to be sure, there's pressure in the marketplace, we don't see any sort of any evidence of a large-scale trend toward unbundling. OK. And let me move toward OPM. So, the conversation about OPM has gone on for a long time, and the conversation about the revenue share model has gone on for a long period of time.
We start from the position that we have excellent relationships, long-term relationships with our universities, and we help those universities fundamentally to succeed. We help them to succeed by providing extremely high-quality programs, by attracting students and by matriculating those students at extremely high completion rates, higher completion rates than typically they see in their on-ground programs. So, insofar as we are doing that, we are helping those universities to succeed. There has long been a conversation about the revenue share model.
Our clients seem to be fine with it. Now, to be sure, there will be some movement in the marketplace there, and therefore, Wiley has adopted again, as we always do, very market friendly practices of working with universities on terms that they believe are fair. And we have our bundled revenue share model businesses, we have our fee-for-service businesses and so forth. So, we believe wherever the market goes, we're going to be fine.
Having said that, we participate very closely in the discussions that go on in Washington and elsewhere on the future of education, generally speaking, and on the future of of higher ed and its relationship with service providers. So, we've responded to the various inquiries. They have been ongoing. We expect them to continue to be ongoing.
But we're very close to it, and we are not -- our confidence in the future is based upon the fact that we're in a consensual relationship, if you call it, with our partners, who are getting a tremendous amount out of it. If we, together, or if they decide they want to go in a different direction, we're very happy to go in a different direction with them, and we always have been. So we don't view it as a major threat.  It's something to be talked about,  It's something to be studied,  It's something to be adapted to.
But we are confident in our position and, more importantly, the position and the quality of the services and the value of the services that we provide to the marketplace.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
This is fantastic and all very convincing. You said in your opening remarks that you had higher completion rates. Did you mean that your OPM program has higher completion rate than equivalent on-campus programs have?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Typically speaking, our programs -- I will say, our programs have very high completion rates for the students that start and those that complete the program. I'll remind you that, historically, when the industry has come under pressure, it has been for universities and education providers that have had extremely low completion rates, such that students started but they never finished and, therefore, never got value for the education that they paid for or that somebody else, such as the government or the taxpayer, paid for. That is absolutely not the case in our programs. The completion rates are extremely high, and our clients are happy with them.
And, clearly, students are happy with them because they're staying through to completion and achieving career outcomes that perpetuate the demand for the product.

Our next question comes from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen. Prior to COVID, rearing its ugly head, margins were eroding. Was that from your conversion from hard copy to digital, or did it relate to state cutbacks in education?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
John, do you want to pick that up?
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, just generally, looking back over fiscal year '20, we did see some erosion of our margin. I would say that the most significant drivers behind that erosion of margin were two. One was the rapid -- continued rapid decline of print, which has reasonably good margins.
But print, as we know, is in decline, and that rate of decline got a bit faster in the past fiscal year and had an impact on our bottom line. We're taking actions, as we discussed in today's review, to improve the profitability of that business by focusing and by, in particular, focusing our future on digital courseware and digital content. The second factor that contributed overall to the shift in the blended margin of the business, there's an increased component of our revenue coming from OPM business that we just talked about. And we recognize that in its current state, the market itself in its current state that operating margins are low.
But we've been emphasizing that we are balancing between top line growth, which is very important to us, and improving profitability there. And we said that we would drive that business to 15% EBITDA margin by next year, and we're well on the march to get there. But those are the two factors that have been putting pressure on our margin, and both of them are being addressed.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
If going forward, there are continued high levels of unemployment, is that a tailwind in that there's a tendency for enrollments in school to go up in that kind of macroeconomic environment?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I'll pick that back up, John. As I was indicating earlier, there is a long term -- and in fact, I think it was either Dan or Drew that pointed it out, there is a long-term established pattern of when the economy goes down and unemployment goes up, that people go back to school. That relationship is typically a lagged relationship, meaning it happens not instantly, it happens 12 to 18 months later, and we do expect to see that.
But we have other tailwinds that are hitting us right now, which is simply that people can't go to school in person. They're physically precluded from going to school fully in person. And so, therefore, we have elevated levels of interest from potential students in taking education in an online world. It also is providing a tailwind, as I indicated earlier, to our digital courseware businesses, which, as I indicated in my remarks, are seeing record increases in usage and adoption because again, if you're not in a physical setting, you need a learning management system based product, something that -- where your teacher can make assignments, where you can do homework, where you can get the content predictably, the content that the teacher needs, not have to Google for your curriculum.
And physical books just aren't as good in those environments. They don't do all those things. And so, there's a significant tailwind that hits you in that sense. And, again, as I indicated, the -- we believe that these are accelerations of long-term trends so that it won't be a short-term blip.
We believe that we're going to see continued elevation of those levels, which is completely -- all of these trends that I'm talking about are completely in sync and aligned with our strategy that we've been working on for the last few years. And  It's gratifying to see it start to come to fruition at a time when the world needs both education and research more than ever.

John Wiley &amp; Sons (A Shares) (NYSE:JW-A)Q1 2021 Earnings CallSep 03, 2020, 10:00 a.m. ET
Contents:
<ul><li>Prepared Remarks</li><li>Questions and Answers</li><li>Call Participants</li></ul>Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Wiley's vice president of investor relations, Brian Campbell. Please go ahead.
Brian Campbell -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter 2021 earnings update. On the call with me are Brian Napack, president and chief executive officer; and John Kritzmacher, chief financial officer. A few reminders to start.
The call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. You shouldn't rely on these statements, as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our SEC filings. The company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Wiley provides non-GAAP measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends.
These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under GAAP. Please see the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures presented in the supplementary information included in our press release. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency, unless otherwise specified.
After the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. I'll now turn the call over to Wiley's president and CEO, Brian Napack. 
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Right now, educators and students around the world are heading back to school and researchers are heading back into their labs in a world significantly altered by COVID-19. As they do, they're rewriting the playbooks for education and research. From our vantage point,  It's clear that they're turning to digital content, platforms and services at unprecedented levels, and they're also turning to corporate partners, such as Wiley, who can help them achieve their goals in a changed world.
The result for Wiley is that across the company, demand for our digital products and services has grown markedly. This unusual moment is moving our markets and proving that the strategies that we have been pursuing are not only right for the market today, they are right for where the market is going in the long term. We had a solid first quarter of revenue and earnings performance despite the disrupted environment. This demonstrated both resilience of our business and tight alignment of our strategies with the market's evolving needs.
We'll talk specifics about our performance shortly, but  It's important to note that today's acute health, economic and social problems serve to reinforce the value of Wiley's mission. Over the past months, we've moved faster to validate and publish more research and have made thousands of critical COVID-related research studies freely available. We've helped many universities, schools and corporations around the world to more quickly migrate from traditional to virtual learning. And we spent lots of time in our communities, raised money for causes that address injustice and taking concrete actions to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion within Wiley.
We continue to be reminded of the racial inequality plaguing our society and the need for corporate citizens, such as us, to play an active role in dismantling it. Our global team takes great pride in the fact that their work is truly helping the world to heal, recover, and thrive. Wiley today remains largely in work-from-home mode, although we have partially opened a few offices around the world where local health conditions allow. I want to recognize the great work of our team in executing at a very high level through this challenging period.
Simply stated, the team continues to deliver on our key milestones and customer commitments. In regular surveys, the vast majority of our colleagues report feeling productive and happy, and their engagement is very high. This can be attributed to our strong mission-driven culture, our tech-enabled workflows and our consistent emphasis on colleague care. The pandemic continues to disrupt the global economy, and this has directly impacted some of our more traditional revenue sources, such as physical books and in person training.
But despite these focused headwinds, we're very encouraged by the underlying momentum we're seeing in education and research. This momentum should continue well beyond the pandemic. We've been talking for some time about the positive trends that are driving research and education. Our growth strategy is built on these trends.
I'm pleased to see that they are accelerating at this moment and that Wiley is capitalizing on them. Research output is rising rapidly. Demand for online education and for the digital courseware to support it is also rising rapidly. The acceleration in these areas speaks well to our long-term outlook.
Internally, we are using the moment to lean into our operational excellence. This includes a focus on improving content workflows, our customer journeys our facilities' footprint and more. John will talk about this later, but there is much we have done and much that we continue to do to improve the efficiency of operations. With that, let me summarize the first quarter's results.
As I said, we continue to see COVID-related disruption to printed books and in-person training in the quarter. Offsetting that was strong growth in key strategic areas, including Open Access publishing, research content usage, online student enrollment and digital courseware. The net result was that revenue rose 2%, adjusted EPS rose 124%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 42%. Organic revenue was down 1%.
I'll provide more detail on all of this in our segment discussions. The material earnings improvement this quarter was primarily driven by favorable revenue performance, particularly in Research, lower discretionary spending and savings from restructuring. Corporate expenses alone were down 16% or $7 million. Let's take a look at the segments.
Our research business continues to perform well. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA rose 6 and 19%, respectively. An important note is that about 4 million of our Q1 revenue came from journal subscription renewals that were delayed from Q4 due to COVID-19. That said, our strategies across the Research business continue to bear fruit.
Article output was up 13%. As you know, this is a key driver of our business models.  It's an outcome of good market growth, our strong publishing programs and our market-friendly publishing strategies. We continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth from our open access publishing program.
Our comprehensive national agreements in Europe are performing well with publishing volumes exceeding our expectations. Usage of the Wiley online library is growing strongly, up 10% over prior year. Our industry-leading society publishing program is having another great year. Net society wins will result in around $11 million of incremental publishing revenue in calendar '21.
In June, we signed a 10-year extension of our important Cochrane Library partnership. For reference, Cochrane is the world's preeminent collection of validated evidence for healthcare decision-makers. Our platform revenue rose 10% on new customer launches for Literatum. We continue to consolidate Literatum's industry-leading position in research content distribution, and our customer retention on a trailing 12-month basis was 98%.
Finally, we expanded our partnership with AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is one of the world's largest scientific societies. As part of this, we'll move the full suite of content from science, a globally celebrated family of journals, onto Literatum. This follows our recent announcement that we have also partnered with AAAS to grow their science career center.
I'll provide a bit of forward-looking color for each of our three segments. In research, our strong market position and diversified revenue streams are providing a solid foundation through this time of change. Calendar '20 subscription agreements are locked in through December of this year, and our calendar '21 renewal season just recently started. We do anticipate that COVID-related budget constraints at libraries will result in some price pressure for '21, but  It's too early to quantify.
In any case, we expect to offset this pressure through the continued strong growth of open access, research platforms and corporate solutions. At the same time, we continue to enhance our end-to-end workflows to improve efficiency and enhance the value proposition for researchers. We've made very good progress already, as evidenced in our strong EBITDA performance, reduced publishing cycle times and improved researcher engagement. In summary, we're seeing strong underlying indicators of future growth and long-term customer health.
In academic and professional learning, or APL, the story is an interesting one. The quarter was significantly affected by COVID due to the closure of bookstores, testing centers and corporate offices. Naturally, this affected the more traditional areas of APL, such as print book publishing, Test Prep services and in-person corporate training. The effect was that APL revenue declined 12, 13% organically, and adjusted EBITDA declined 23%.
But despite this short-term pressure, there's good news for the future in our KPIs. We're seeing quite positive trends in digital content and courseware as universities and companies pivot to virtual learning. We appear to be in an inflection point for digital content and digital courseware with record growth of 32 and 88%, respectively, on a pro forma basis. Our strategy to focus tightly on high-demand skills and careers is paying off.
In higher ed, we are gaining market share. Our share has grown from 4% in July 2018 to nearly 5% in July 2020 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our innovative zyBooks and Alta digital offerings are winning adoptions at an impressive pace. For example, zyBooks, our STEM platform, saw revenue double over the prior year, and it is winning consistently in large course adoptions.
So actually, I'm feeling good about the future of APL despite this quarter's COVID-19-related declines in our traditional business lines. For the remainder of the year, we expect that current trends will continue, namely that print book sales will continue to be challenged by COVID lockdowns and virtual learning. Note that print books represent a smaller portion of Wiley's overall business. Digital content and courseware will continue to grow strongly, helping to mitigate any potential decline this fall in higher ed enrollment.
Recovery in test prep will be dependent upon the reopening of testing sites and the resumption of certification exams. In corporate learning, we're seeing an acceleration of our virtual and hybrid corporate training products. We anticipate a strong post-pandemic recovery based upon what we are seeing in platform usage and new partner signings. Throughout APL, we're moving quickly to take advantage of the abrupt shift to digital learning by investing in our platforms and our go-to-market strategies.
This includes our value-driven business models that make content affordable. An example is our Inclusive Access program, which continues to grow very strongly. We are also responding to the moment by publishing timely titles on topics such as running businesses virtually and creating diverse, inclusive and equitable cultures. Finally, we're driving rapid and significant improvement in our cost structure to improve efficiency and our margin profile.
Our education services segment is positioned very well for this moment as universities, students and professionals are pivoting hard to both digital learning and online degrees. It will take time to fully realize the potential of this shift, but interest in our services, which help universities to succeed with online education, is running very high. For the quarter, revenue was up 29%, or 4% organically, and our EBITDA margin was 13%, which is up 9% for fiscal '20. Revenue growth was driven by $12 million of inorganic contribution from M3, as well as 9% growth in student enrollment.
Our mature and new programs are performing well, although organic growth was offset by small partner terminations as part of our continuous portfolio optimization. Our full-service partner count now stands at 67. We added two new full-service university partners in the quarter, the University of New Haven in Connecticut and Carlow University in Pennsylvania, and we signed additional universities for unbundled service agreements. Online program enrollment was very healthy this summer and remains so as we enter the fall semester.
At M3, we found the corporate demand for trained IT talent to be more stable in the pandemic than we had expected. Our existing customer base is solid, and we've begun placing new talent at several recently signed customers. Notably, we're gaining momentum in India where we are currently staffing a major new technology center for one of our global financial services clients. University services are facing significant pressures this year.
Universities are facing significant pressures this year as they simultaneously shift to hybrid and virtual learning while also dealing with financial shortfalls brought on by COVID-related enrollment declines. Although intermediate and long-term trends are very good, there is some near-term uncertainty to manage through with our clients. As with digital courseware, online education is now past the inflection point and is broadly adopted and accepted as a mainstream way to get a degree or certification. This was true before COVID, but the disruption of the past six months has driven home the value of high-quality, fairly priced education that can fit the life and career needs of the broad public.
This moment is reflected in enrollment trends and good pipeline of potential university partnerships, both in the U.S. and abroad and with our key partners, most of whom are evaluating online expansion opportunities. M3's IT talent placement volume is anticipated to be steady for the balance of the year as our corporate partners continue to maintain and grow their tech talent capacity. Major operational focus within education service is the continued improvement of the student journey from lead to enrollment.
These efforts continue to bear fruit in higher conversion rates and lower student acquisition costs. The business is well on track to realize its fiscal '22 goal of the 15% EBITDA margin. I'll now pass the call over to John to take you through our financial profile and optimization initiatives.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Brian. Despite a very challenging environment, we are generally pleased with our revenue and earnings performance for this quarter. That said, our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were unfavorable to prior year by $27 million and $20 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of changes in working capital. As a reminder, our cash flow is normally the use of cash in the first half of our fiscal year due to timing of collection for general subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
Capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, declined $6 million to $24 million for the quarter. As discussed on the last earnings call, we expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, with investment focused on new product and service capabilities, as well as process redesign and workflow automation. With respect to investment in acquisitions, we will remain opportunistic and continue our pursuit of attractive opportunities to add scale and provide enhanced tech-enabled products and services in both research and online education. In terms of our balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was up $117 million primarily due to acquisitions, but our interest expense was lower by $1.5 million as we realized the benefit of the lower interest rate environment.
Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.0 times, inclusive of all acquisitions. In terms of access to capital, we reported $101 million of cash on hand, and we ended the quarter with undrawn revolving credit of $650 million. Our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity afford us the flexibility to continue investing, acquiring and returning cash to shareholders. In June, the company modestly increased its quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.
Our current dividend yield is more than 4%. As a reminder, due to the economic downturn, we have refrained from repurchasing shares. We remain fully confident in our continued strategic momentum, cash generation and liquidity position, and we expect to resume share repurchases as the economic environment recovers. We are moving quickly on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the economic downturn and improve our agility and efficiency.
These programs are companywide and include optimizing our content development workflows, streamlining our customer support operations and achieving benchmark efficiency levels for corporate support functions, such as HR and finance. Meanwhile, we continue to maintain tight controls on discretionary spending across the company, and we have realized significant savings on travel, marketing events and professional fees. In addition, hiring and salary increases have been strictly limited to critical business needs and investment in our top performers. And in June, the executive leadership team and the board unanimously agreed to take six-month pay cuts ranging from 15% to 30%.
And as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a $15 million restructuring charge for actions that will generate annual run rate savings of approximately $30 million. Additional cost savings actions are anticipated in the current fiscal year. As an example, we are taking actions to rationalize our real estate portfolio given our successful transition to a virtual work environment. We will update you on our progress as the anticipated savings -- and the anticipated savings we will make throughout the year.
In summary, we are very well positioned to navigate the COVID-related challenges ahead while investing in key optimization and growth initiatives. As a reminder, given our limited visibility in the current economic environment, we have suspended our practice of providing annual guidance. We expect to return to providing guidance when the economic environment becomes more stable and our visibility improves. I'll now pass the call back to Brian.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. So, to recap the main messages for today, our business remains strong through the pandemic with good momentum continuing in both research and education services. We're experiencing COVID-related disruptions to print books and in-person training. Of course, this represents a smaller part of Wiley today, with nearly 80% of our revenue coming from digital products and tech-enabled services.
Core trends remain favorable in Wiley's key strategic areas of focus, such as peer-reviewed research, online education, digital content and courseware. We're taking full advantage of this unusual moment to drive improvement in the cost structure and core functioning of Wiley, focusing on high potential areas, such as our content development workflows, our management of the customer life cycle and the tuning of our real estate footprint for an increasingly virtual workforce. Overall, we're confident in the enduring importance of our Research and Education content, platforms and services. But more importantly, we're optimistic that this challenging moment -- at this challenging moment because we're seeing compelling evidence in our KPIs that our markets are strong and that our strategies are working.
To be specific, we're experiencing strong growth in demand to publish in our journals and consumer research, strong growth in Research platform signings, recurring revenue and content consumption with 98% client retention, strong growth in our digital courseware portfolio, strong growth in enrollment at our online degree programs and increased interest of universities in accelerating the transition to online education. So despite some near-term headwinds, the data tells me that we're tightly aligned with the current and long-term needs of our customers, the researchers, students, professors, administrators and corporate leaders that we serve worldwide. Once again, I want to thank our wonderful Wiley colleagues around the world for their grit, their positive spirit and their remarkable accomplishments this quarter. With that, I'll open the floor to your comments and questions.
Questions &amp; Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with research. Obviously, a really solid growth in a difficult environment.
How much of the jump in article output and content consumption would you contribute to COVID-related research? And as a follow-up, how much of the jump in research revenue and EBITDA reflects things like reprints and back files, open access? Just trying to get a sense for that relative to maybe the kind of legacy Research business, if you will.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start, and John can chip in. So, we're seeing -- definitely seeing good momentum in Research publishing. The COVID crisis has definitely increased the interest in -- or the output of researchers, and we see no signs of that declining.
With respect to specific COVID-related research, we certainly are publishing more COVID-related papers, as you would expect. But as a percentage of our total,  It's a very small percentage.  It's really a much broader --  It's a much broader increase in demand that we're seeing at this point in time that's coming across the portfolio. And to answer your second question, a large portion of that is coming in open access.
So, we're seeing really good growth rates in our open access pay-to-publish models, which, as you know, is a price times quantity model. So, when that happens, that translates directly into our revenue base. So we're definitely feeling consistent and increasing demand. And the practices that we've taken in the marketplace, which have been very market friendly, we believe, are leading researchers to choose Wiley and choose our journal.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Indeed. And on OA specifically, is it more article output from the same customers? More interest from new parties? How would you sort of weigh those two?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you know, in Open Access, the researchers themselves are deciding where to submit their articles. And as they do, they're choosing the titles, meaning the journal titles, and the publishers that they want to work with. So, increasingly,  It's almost a B2C model in that case. And so, things like the reputation, the quality of the customer experience, the researcher experience as they go through the publishing process, the speed with which the article gets out and the quality with which it gets promoted are what drives that.
So, we believe that we're seeing researchers choose us, quite simply stated. If that answers your question, Dan. If I didn't answer it specifically, please follow up.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
No, that helps. Absolutely. Maybe one or two quick follow-ups. The -- given the growth in OA, if we were to break down Research between kind of annual contracted revenue versus more variable or consumption-based, what would that look like at this stage percentage-wise?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, currently, as you look at our -- go ahead, John. Yes.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
I'll answer this in a way that is also responsive, Dan, to your question about what was the composition of revenue in the quarter. Roughly speaking, about 80% of our revenue comes from the combination of subscriptions and open access. And within that, call it, 70% of our research publishing business is subscription and about 10% of it is OA. The remaining 20% of our business, Dan, is, frankly, largely products and services that are derivatives of articles that are published under subscription, such as reprints that you mentioned and such as corporate advertising.
So, that's roughly the split of revenue that we have today. And of course, the subscription base is largely contracted, right? So that's well in play, but we're coming up on a renewal season. You asked whether -- you asked about are there significant backhaul revenues or such in the quarter, and the answer to that is no. This was a pretty normal quarter for us in terms of the composition of products and services that drove our revenue.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
That's helpful because that can be really high margin. One more, and I'll jump out. But you alluded, Brian, to obviously the extraordinary pressures that universities will be facing. Given where the stock is and has been trading, I think there's a lot more fear out there than -- well, may or may not warranted, we'll see.
But I know you don't want to get into the guidance, but when you think about Research, is there a range -- I guess, one, how are those initial dialogues going for calendar '21? And two, is there a range of revenue growth that you might be able to -- at an extreme high, extreme low bracket to sort of rein in some of the fears out there? Maybe  It's too early, but I thought I'd give you the opportunity.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah, look, I mean,  It's a completely fair question, and  It's what we want to know as well. We're talking to our customers very, very closely, and we're trying to get a sense of it. But  It's really early in the renewal season, and so it really is too early to tell.
We do expect some price pressure. But we expect that that price pressure should be offset by this strong growth that you're seeing in OA and in platforms and other areas. So, the simple answer is  It's too early to tell but that we believe that the price pressure we face will be modest and that it will be largely offset, if not more than offset, by our open access growth.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
OK. Helpful. I'll follow up with -- jump back in queue with any follow-up.
Operator
Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, Brian, historically, when GDP has fallen and unemployment has risen, enrollment trends have accelerated. And listening to your preamble, it doesn't sound like that's what you're seeing or anticipating for the fall semester, but just want to get more detail around that.
And then, on a related note, the 4% organic growth for Ed Services that you reported in the quarter, is that indicative of what we should anticipate for the balance of fiscal '21? And then, I have a follow-up.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Got it. So, from the perspective of the demand patterns in higher ed, this -- there's no question that there is a relationship between GDP, unemployment and college enrollment. That -- historically, that relationship has been one with a bit of a lag, a 12 to 18-month lag. And so, we do expect that to play out here, and we believe we're already seeing it in our leads, in our interest and in our enrollment.
But really, traditionally, that's played out over time. What's happening now in enrollment is different than that, though. What's happening now is literally a practical preclusion on universities from running schools as they normally had and a depression or a downward pressure on enrollment that's come from health fears related to being in large groups of people, as everybody knows. So, what we're seeing -- the enrollment pressure we're seeing is not some sort of an inverse relationship to the tradition.
In fact,  It's a novel pressure. And that novel pressure was expected in the fall to be in the neighborhood of 10 or 15%. We think it could be on the lower end of that. But from Wiley's perspective, and this is really important, from Wiley's perspective, our -- and that has -- that, by the way, will affect our principal sales.
But from Wiley's perspective, our strategic growth areas are digital courseware and online education, and those run counter to the trends that we're seeing in the market because if you can't go to school in person, you go online. Or if you're supposed to -- if you're usually in a classroom, but now you're going to be studying from home in a virtual environment, you have no choice but to get the digital materials. You can't share. You can't -- a book is not going to help because you need to be in the courseware.
So, that is contributing to an upswell in the parts of that business that we are strategically focused on in the future. So both in the services business, where we're focused on online enrollment, and in the courseware business or the content business, where we're focused on digital content and courseware, we actually believe that this is a material change that will have a long-term benefit for the business. Then answering second part of your question, we are seeing -- obviously, results are backward-looking. And in the spring, we definitely saw some shock to the system from COVID that affected enrollments.
It just -- this is not surprising. But over this summer, we started to see elevated levels of interest in our -- in lead generation and in conversion, leading to pretty good enrollment trend. So, our enrollment actually was up around 9% recently, and then we should see some of that continue. But again, we're just getting into the semester.
We'll just see exactly how this start goes. And so, we're not at all pessimistic. Quite the contrary, we're optimistic about where that business is going and the enrollment trends due to the things that I've been talking about, both the short-term shift to online translating into a greater acceptance of online learning and online education where it is really is the norm now in many cases for a large portion of people getting postsecondary educations, and then followed by what we expect to be a significant, economically driven increase in interest in education due to the inverse relationship that you identified before between the economy and enrollment in schools.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Got it. OK. Very helpful. And then, I know you spent a lot of time talking about open access, and it, obviously, had a very good quarter.
Just any updated thoughts around the sustainability of that growth? And then, separately, John, can you address the timing-related working capital issues that impacted your cash flow during the quarter?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll pick up the OA question first. We're -- long before COVID, we were seeing significantly greater volumes of submissions and consequent volumes of our output. That has continued and increase through COVID-19.
We see no reason to believe that  It's not going to continue. There might be a slight elevation now that's related to researchers being at home and finishing up papers. You think that would've been done already, and yet the elevated levels continue, and in fact, they're increasing. So, we're very bullish on those volumes levels continuing at a high level on a go-forward basis.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
And then, Drew, on your question with respect to cash flow and, in particular, the impact of working capital that I referenced in my comments, which were the biggest drivers. I mean, by the way, we had very strong performance in the quarter from a real earnings growth perspective, but then working capital played against us. And in particular, I would note that our cash collections associated with journals were pretty strong and in line with our expectations, so we're feeling good about collections there. We do have some customers that have requested extended terms, but  It's not a material impact to our results, and we feel like that's flowing well.
The most significant impact on the timing of working capital has to do with payables. In the March -- late March and April time frame, like others, we went into a bit of cash conservation mode given potential risks around liquidity in the market at that point in time. And so, we put some pressure on payables at that time. And then, as things began to ease up in our first quarter, we also eased up on payables.
So, the ground that we gave up on cash flow in the quarter is particularly concentrated around payables, and  It's just sort of the normal flow back to a balance after conserving cash at the end of the fourth quarter.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
OK. All right guys appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Sami Kassab with Exane.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my questions, I have three of them, please. The first one is on a topic that I think you've just touched on, but I would kindly like you to perhaps elaborate a little bit more.
On open access, what's the risk that the elevated levels of submissions that we've seen actually reflect the fact that scientists have been locked down at home and away from their labs and had a lot of time to write papers but had no ability to make progress on their scientific research and that those three, four months will actually, six months, 12 months down the road, will lead to a slowdown in open access growth as science did not really happen through the lockdowns? Secondly, on China, we've seen the Chinese government communicate new research appraisal policies, pushing Chinese scientists to publish more into Chinese local language journals, [Inaudible] moving away from splicing. Do you think the China policy and regulatory changes may have an impact, or is that too small to matter? Is that not something that is big on your radar screen? Then lastly, can you elaborate a little bit on how you see the regulatory environment in OPM? We've had the likes of Bob Sherman and Senator Warren look at OPM. Do you think the regulatory environment could be at risk of changing? Or do you think  It's a solid regime that you have today and you have no major concerns on the regulatory front for OPM?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you very much for asking three questions, each of which is a dissertation. So, I'll take them one at a time. They're very good questions, excellent questions that I'd be asking if I were you. So the first one, on the risk of the elevated level of OA sort of bringing back to some lower level later, we are now six or more months into this pandemic; seven or eight, depending on where you're looking in the world.
We continue to see elevated levels. We continue to see researchers putting out papers. Researchers are going back into the labs, absolutely. And so, we're -- we expect it to continue at some level.
Could it come back a little bit? Of course, it could. We're at a very high level right now. But I will remind you that trends in research are very, very positive in terms of overall increasing volume of output in the marketplace. So, in other words, we see mid to high-single-digit increases in the volume of papers every year.
And that long preceded the environment. We consider that will continue in the future. The second thing is that the research continues to be something that is funded at a very high level. In countries around the world, we see no we see no signs of that declining.
So, yeah, I mean, there's no question that there could be a little bit of an artificial increase, but those artificial -- those increases have continued for quite some time now. The final thing I'd say on that is we believe that our publishing program and our approach to publishing is extremely researcher and market friendly, and we think we're getting more than our fair share of submissions. I'll also remind you that of all the submissions we get, we publish a very small portion of them, and so there's always increasing potential there. So, no, I don't see a snapback or a rebound that goes the wrong way on us in the future.
Now, the question of China, another really good question. China is a super important market in the future of research. China is a very important producer and consumer of research. China represents around 5% of our research publishing business now.
So, from a business perspective,  It's not going to swing us one way or the other in any given quarter, but it is very important in the long run, and we are -- and the increasing discussion in China about their endemic -- or indigenous publishing is certainly an important move and important trend. But we have very, very close relationships in China. We have a very good connection to the government agencies and so forth there, and we continue to stay very close to them. Chinese researchers want their journals to be in the best journals in the world so that they can get the recognition and the -- for their work that they desire, and we believe our publishing portfolio leads us there.
But also, we are increasingly partnering in China to make sure that we are seen as the publisher of choice. So, while there is some -- there's always some concern when there are discussions going on in places like China about changes in policy, we believe that, ultimately, we're very well positioned to capitalize on what is still continuing significant growth in both Chinese publishing and Chinese consumption. On the --
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Sorry, may I squeeze in a follow-up before we move to OPM? In subscription unbundling and sub has seen some strong takeup, a third of R1 universities on unsub within less than a year. Do you see a trend or risk toward more unbundling of the big deals, especially in the U.S. as universities face budgetary pressure?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So, if the question is about unbundling and whether we are seeing more or we'll be seeing more, as universities face pressure, they certainly are looking for ways to save cost. I've said we can't really comment on what we expect that pricing pressure to be. But as we look into the market, we don't see a lot of evidence.
We see some one-off cases, but we don't see a lot of evidence of universities and university librarians saying we don't need that content, our researchers don't need it, we're not using it. So, to the extent that we have a high -- which we do, a very high-quality portfolio of journals that is essential to the success of research, we will continue to be purchased by those universities. I'll remind you that academics make their careers based upon research, and universities climb the rankings or to descend in the rankings based upon their positioning in the research ecosystem and both the volume and the quality of their output. So, research and research content is absolutely central to the success of our important clients.
So, while we may see some edge cases because, to be sure, there's pressure in the marketplace, we don't see any sort of any evidence of a large-scale trend toward unbundling. OK. And let me move toward OPM. So, the conversation about OPM has gone on for a long time, and the conversation about the revenue share model has gone on for a long period of time.
We start from the position that we have excellent relationships, long-term relationships with our universities, and we help those universities fundamentally to succeed. We help them to succeed by providing extremely high-quality programs, by attracting students and by matriculating those students at extremely high completion rates, higher completion rates than typically they see in their on-ground programs. So, insofar as we are doing that, we are helping those universities to succeed. There has long been a conversation about the revenue share model.
Our clients seem to be fine with it. Now, to be sure, there will be some movement in the marketplace there, and therefore, Wiley has adopted again, as we always do, very market friendly practices of working with universities on terms that they believe are fair. And we have our bundled revenue share model businesses, we have our fee-for-service businesses and so forth. So, we believe wherever the market goes, we're going to be fine.
Having said that, we participate very closely in the discussions that go on in Washington and elsewhere on the future of education, generally speaking, and on the future of of higher ed and its relationship with service providers. So, we've responded to the various inquiries. They have been ongoing. We expect them to continue to be ongoing.
But we're very close to it, and we are not -- our confidence in the future is based upon the fact that we're in a consensual relationship, if you call it, with our partners, who are getting a tremendous amount out of it. If we, together, or if they decide they want to go in a different direction, we're very happy to go in a different direction with them, and we always have been. So we don't view it as a major threat.  It's something to be talked about,  It's something to be studied,  It's something to be adapted to.

This is fantastic and all very convincing. You said in your opening remarks that you had higher completion rates. Did you mean that your OPM program has higher completion rate than equivalent on-campus programs have?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Typically speaking, our programs -- I will say, our programs have very high completion rates for the students that start and those that complete the program. I'll remind you that, historically, when the industry has come under pressure, it has been for universities and education providers that have had extremely low completion rates, such that students started but they never finished and, therefore, never got value for the education that they paid for or that somebody else, such as the government or the taxpayer, paid for. That is absolutely not the case in our programs. The completion rates are extremely high, and our clients are happy with them.
And, clearly, students are happy with them because they're staying through to completion and achieving career outcomes that perpetuate the demand for the product.

Our next question comes from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen. Prior to COVID, rearing its ugly head, margins were eroding. Was that from your conversion from hard copy to digital, or did it relate to state cutbacks in education?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
John, do you want to pick that up?
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, just generally, looking back over fiscal year '20, we did see some erosion of our margin. I would say that the most significant drivers behind that erosion of margin were two. One was the rapid -- continued rapid decline of print, which has reasonably good margins.
But print, as we know, is in decline, and that rate of decline got a bit faster in the past fiscal year and had an impact on our bottom line. We're taking actions, as we discussed in today's review, to improve the profitability of that business by focusing and by, in particular, focusing our future on digital courseware and digital content. The second factor that contributed overall to the shift in the blended margin of the business, there's an increased component of our revenue coming from OPM business that we just talked about. And we recognize that in its current state, the market itself in its current state that operating margins are low.
But we've been emphasizing that we are balancing between top line growth, which is very important to us, and improving profitability there. And we said that we would drive that business to 15% EBITDA margin by next year, and we're well on the march to get there. But those are the two factors that have been putting pressure on our margin, and both of them are being addressed.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
If going forward, there are continued high levels of unemployment, is that a tailwind in that there's a tendency for enrollments in school to go up in that kind of macroeconomic environment?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I'll pick that back up, John. As I was indicating earlier, there is a long term -- and in fact, I think it was either Dan or Drew that pointed it out, there is a long-term established pattern of when the economy goes down and unemployment goes up, that people go back to school. That relationship is typically a lagged relationship, meaning it happens not instantly, it happens 12 to 18 months later, and we do expect to see that.
But we have other tailwinds that are hitting us right now, which is simply that people can't go to school in person. They're physically precluded from going to school fully in person. And so, therefore, we have elevated levels of interest from potential students in taking education in an online world. It also is providing a tailwind, as I indicated earlier, to our digital courseware businesses, which, as I indicated in my remarks, are seeing record increases in usage and adoption because again, if you're not in a physical setting, you need a learning management system based product, something that -- where your teacher can make assignments, where you can do homework, where you can get the content predictably, the content that the teacher needs, not have to Google for your curriculum.
And physical books just aren't as good in those environments. They don't do all those things. And so, there's a significant tailwind that hits you in that sense. And, again, as I indicated, the -- we believe that these are accelerations of long-term trends so that it won't be a short-term blip.
We believe that we're going to see continued elevation of those levels, which is completely -- all of these trends that I'm talking about are completely in sync and aligned with our strategy that we've been working on for the last few years. And  It's gratifying to see it start to come to fruition at a time when the world needs both education and research more than ever.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Great. Thank you for taking my questions I appreciate it.
Operator
And I'm not showing any further questions at this time and would like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks.

Yeah, that's me, the host. Thank you very much all for joining us today, and we'll look forward to reviewing our second-quarter results in December. Wish you all good luck and good health, and we'll see you soon.

345,kj@mentedcosmetics.com,"With $4 billion in sales in 12 months and a rosy forecast ahead, lipstick manufacturers were smiling at the end of 2019, and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing face masks and an unstable economy. With no end to the crisis in sight, brands large and small have had to adjust manufacturing, advertising, and social media on the fly. The results, they say, are paying off — and may mark the beginning of profound changes for the cosmetics industry.
Beyond changes in everyday demand for lip color, some businesses have found themselves re-examining everything from their supply chain up. E.L.F. Beauty, a mass-market brand founded in 2004, reacted to the pandemic earlier than most, according to Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer, because it sources its products abroad. It made changes in early January — weeks before Western countries entered lockdown — when its operation in China was impacted. It has managed to adjust and keep customers supplied, but has noticed a shift in what people are buying. 
Lipstick has slid, most likely because people cared less about the colors of their lips when they're all having to wear masks and the economic fallout of lockdown, but sales of other items rose to pick up the slack.
""We saw a surge in the market around bronzer and brow, so we swiftly deployed assets and messaging to accelerate E.L.F. bronzers and brow products,"" Marchisotto says. ""As we continue navigating through COVID-19, we closely monitor consumer signals and learn that they don't just change monthly or weekly during this crisis. They can change daily or even hourly.""
These shifts are happening across the industry. A May report from McKinsey, the consultancy giant, found cosmetics sales had dropped 55% among prestige brands. ""When consumers do return to work, many will continue to wear masks, further slowing makeup's recovery,"" the report said. However, the report noted that sales of skin-, nail- and hair-care products in Europe had quadrupled, as more people pampered themselves at home — and a September report from market research firm NPD found that more women in the US were using facial skincare products than in 2019.
This constant adjustment has been particularly challenging for independent brands, which may not have the cash or infrastructure to absorb huge drops in sales or swings in their inventory. For Mented, a growing, Black-owned brand with a dedicated following for its highly-pigmented color cosmetics, the pandemic has proved challenging — but surprising, in a good way.
Cofounder Amanda E. Johnson says: ""We were planning on having a great 2020 and then March hit. It was slow in the beginning for everybody, because COVID shook the world and no one knew what was going on. So, we thought, 'oh, we're going to have a horrible year like everyone else.'""
The company adjusted its forecast down 40% and braced for disaster, but was shocked when April's sales figures came in. ""We were like, ""Oh my God, this is the biggest month in the history of the company. It must be an anomaly."" It wasn't. Sales are actually trending up and projections have been readjusted.
Amanda E. Johnson, cofounder and COO of Mented Cosmetics.
Mented Cosmetics
Johnson says the fact the business has always been online only helped — as did its focus on people of color. She also believes that lipstick, despite rising mask-wearing, is finding its place in the pandemic with two very different kinds of consumers. ""One, there's the professional that's working from home. So, if she is working from home, she's on Zoom and Team and Google Hangout calls all day long"" and secondly, ""the essential worker. So, we've asked, why are you still putting on lipstick every day? And what we've heard back is, because 'I need something to make me feel good right now.'""
Marchisotto agrees, predicting the business will keep promoting beauty as an important element of self-care in a difficult time. One nurse wrote to the company saying its primer had changed her life — this kind of direct feedback is important at a time when all historical models of trends are obsolete. ""It was another moment for us to understand the power of our products. We don't just sell beauty."" 
While the path forward is still unclear, Johnson is beginning to think that marketing products as an indulgence could prove successful. ""Women are definitely still buying makeup in droves,"" she says, but adds that the difference is ""they want brands to tell them that they're doing the right thing.""
It remains to be seen which platforms are best for telling buyers that. TikTok, Home Shopping Network, and Instagram have all shown good results for these brands. The message is clearly one consumers want to hear. ""Historically, color cosmetics has been a 'recession-proof product,'"" Johnson said. ""And I think what we're seeing is, in some ways, it is also pandemic proof.""","I just read that Mented Cosmetics had a rosy forecast ahead of 2019 and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing face masks and an unstable economy. Undoubtedly, sales of other items rose to pick up the slack?",

342,matt@logrocket.com,"Matthew!?!LogRocket!?!In an unprecedented year that saw many teams shift to remote working, we asked tech and business leaders to pick their essential tools.
Throughout our Leaders Insights series on Siliconrepublic.com last year, we asked a host of tech and business leaders from Ireland and further afield to name the essential tools and resources that get them through the working week.
In a year that brought major disruption to most of our working lives, they turned to video conferencing, collaboration software and a whole lot of coffee.
Handy hardware
The move away from offices means many of us are now relying on tech devices for both work and keeping in touch. Seán Keating of Vilicom said his number-one tool is his smartphone. Its like the Swiss army knife of business tools. It keeps me on schedule, navigates to meetings, runs all our most important business apps, connects my laptop to our IT cloud, enables our Teams communications and more.
HPs Gary Tierney said that his phone and laptop are the must-have items for work, but since the arrival of Covid-19 he has been relying more on his laptop. Ive found that working from home has put an even greater emphasis on the criticality of my PC as a communication tool and a general workhorse.
Many people also had to figure out a new at-home work set-up last year. I recently invested in a 38-inch ultra-wide monitor and its been a game changer for me, Joe Lennon of Workvivo told us over the summer.
Video conferencing
2020 was the year we all became very familiar with Zoom (as well as Zoombombing and Zoom fatigue).
Amy Bunszel of Autodesk said she now spends most of her day on Zoom, and Patrick Horgan of Horizon8 said tools such as Zoom are proving incredibly helpful in the work-from-home dynamic.
But there are plenty of other alternatives out there. Microsoft Teams was highlighted as an essential daily tool by plenty of people, including SL Controls Keith Moran, CWSIs Ronan Murphy and Avanades Graham Healy.
Martin McKay of Texthelp said he couldnt be without the Google Meet and Chat tools at the moment, and Xilinxs Brendan Farley said Skype and Webex are other options being used for video calls.
Online collaboration tools are integral to not just our success but our basic functioning, added Ogie Sheehy of ViClarity. Whether it is Zoom or GoToMeeting, Google Chat or Microsoft Teams, these tools are enabling us to continue to work uninterrupted across a global footprint. 
Software saviours
While Microsoft Teams has seen a sharp rise in users in the past year, many companies have been relying on other products from the Microsoft 365 stack. Ronan Murphy of CWSI said these tools allow his company to do whatever we need to do from wherever we are.
SoftwareOnes Una Keeshan said she uses the focus plan in Microsoft MyAnalytics to set aside time for priority work, while Avanades Graham Healy said he uses Microsoft Dynamics for customer relationship management and Power BI for reporting, forecasting and analytics.
With teams dispersed, messaging and collaboration tools such as Slack also came to the fore. Its a convenient way to collaborate over projects and to organise ourselves according to different topics and business functions, said Oz Alashe of CybSafe.
Collaboration tools have always been important for developers. Joe Lennon of Workvivo said GitHub is fundamental for his engineering team to manage source code and code reviews, and they regularly use Tuple to do remote pair programming.
Jennifer Sethre of Intry said Intercom and LogRocket are important tools for her HR tech company, and Keith Moran of SL Controls turns to the Frankli platform for engaging with his team.
Lettertecs Frank Kelly uses Google Keep for jotting quick notes down as they occur, while ViClaritys Ogie Sheehy is a fan of the voice dictation app on his iPhone. It allows me to be immediately responsive to important emails that come through when I am out and about and away from my desk, he said.
A good old-fashioned to-do list
While there may be a fancy tech tool for everything, many leaders still rely on a simple to-do list to keep focused. Nessa McEniff of Learnovate said listing her priorities is a key part of the week and shes a bit of an obsessive list maker.
Netssos Brian ODoherty added that a having a clear list keeps him grounded. I set myself a weekly list and find that its a great way of keeping the faith in myself, my work and my ambitions, he said.
But Liz Cunningham of Google said she is still looking for the perfect tool that will manage all her to-do lists across personal and work life to help keep all the balls in the air.
PayPals Annette Hickey noted that her calendar helps keep her focused throughout the week, and Dells Jason Ward said an organised calendar is key to ensuring I am as productive as possible.
Keeping the mind clear
The sudden shift to remote working means that many have had to find new ways to focus, while still maintaining a good work-life balance and not overworking now that your kitchen may be your office.
To help with this, Nicole Sahin of Globalization Partners said she keeps Fridays free of Zoom meetings. Its like heaven to have that time to think and get things done.
Similarly, Codemas Donna Gartland said that, since the shift to working from home, she now blocks time in her calendar each week without meetings to focus and get deep work done. I use distraction blockers across all my devices, she added, such as Stay Focusd on my browser and Focus mode on Pixel.
Xilinxs Brendan Farley said he removed the work email app from his phone many years ago, which helps him switch off in the evenings. And Mark Cockerill of ServiceNow suggested having a great Spotify playlist on hand.
Getting away from the desk
For minding mental and physical health, many other leaders also suggested getting out and about. SL Controls Keith Moran enjoys a good game of squash in the evening, Arkphires Paul Nannetti tries to run on the beach a few times a week, and Fenergos Louise OConnell said that yoga or a walk in the fresh air can help to just clear the mind.
Una Keeshan of SoftwareOne has recently taken tennis back up as a hobby. The tennis is not only great exercise, she said, but also helps me clear my head from work or the stresses of the day.
And Autodesks Amy Bunszel said that, now she doesnt have a commute for the time being, its a bit easier to make time for exercise every morning and a nice dinner in the evening.
Food certainly plays a key part in the day for many. Horizon8s Patrick Horgan said the barbecue has proved an essential tool for bringing his family together in the current environment.
And one of the essential tools to get Dells Jason Ward through the week? Coffee, coffee and more coffee.",,

John Wiley &amp; Sons (A Shares) (NYSE:JW-A)Q1 2021 Earnings CallSep 03, 2020, 10:00 a.m. ET
Contents:
<ul><li>Prepared Remarks</li><li>Questions and Answers</li><li>Call Participants</li></ul>Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Wiley's vice president of investor relations, Brian Campbell. Please go ahead.
Brian Campbell -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter 2021 earnings update. On the call with me are Brian Napack, president and chief executive officer; and John Kritzmacher, chief financial officer. A few reminders to start.
The call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. You shouldn't rely on these statements, as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our SEC filings. The company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Wiley provides non-GAAP measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends.
These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under GAAP. Please see the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures presented in the supplementary information included in our press release. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency, unless otherwise specified.
After the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. I'll now turn the call over to Wiley's president and CEO, Brian Napack. 
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Right now, educators and students around the world are heading back to school and researchers are heading back into their labs in a world significantly altered by COVID-19. As they do, they're rewriting the playbooks for education and research. From our vantage point,  It's clear that they're turning to digital content, platforms and services at unprecedented levels, and they're also turning to corporate partners, such as Wiley, who can help them achieve their goals in a changed world.
The result for Wiley is that across the company, demand for our digital products and services has grown markedly. This unusual moment is moving our markets and proving that the strategies that we have been pursuing are not only right for the market today, they are right for where the market is going in the long term. We had a solid first quarter of revenue and earnings performance despite the disrupted environment. This demonstrated both resilience of our business and tight alignment of our strategies with the market's evolving needs.
We'll talk specifics about our performance shortly, but  It's important to note that today's acute health, economic and social problems serve to reinforce the value of Wiley's mission. Over the past months, we've moved faster to validate and publish more research and have made thousands of critical COVID-related research studies freely available. We've helped many universities, schools and corporations around the world to more quickly migrate from traditional to virtual learning. And we spent lots of time in our communities, raised money for causes that address injustice and taking concrete actions to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion within Wiley.
We continue to be reminded of the racial inequality plaguing our society and the need for corporate citizens, such as us, to play an active role in dismantling it. Our global team takes great pride in the fact that their work is truly helping the world to heal, recover, and thrive. Wiley today remains largely in work-from-home mode, although we have partially opened a few offices around the world where local health conditions allow. I want to recognize the great work of our team in executing at a very high level through this challenging period.
Simply stated, the team continues to deliver on our key milestones and customer commitments. In regular surveys, the vast majority of our colleagues report feeling productive and happy, and their engagement is very high. This can be attributed to our strong mission-driven culture, our tech-enabled workflows and our consistent emphasis on colleague care. The pandemic continues to disrupt the global economy, and this has directly impacted some of our more traditional revenue sources, such as physical books and in person training.
But despite these focused headwinds, we're very encouraged by the underlying momentum we're seeing in education and research. This momentum should continue well beyond the pandemic. We've been talking for some time about the positive trends that are driving research and education. Our growth strategy is built on these trends.
I'm pleased to see that they are accelerating at this moment and that Wiley is capitalizing on them. Research output is rising rapidly. Demand for online education and for the digital courseware to support it is also rising rapidly. The acceleration in these areas speaks well to our long-term outlook.
Internally, we are using the moment to lean into our operational excellence. This includes a focus on improving content workflows, our customer journeys our facilities' footprint and more. John will talk about this later, but there is much we have done and much that we continue to do to improve the efficiency of operations. With that, let me summarize the first quarter's results.
As I said, we continue to see COVID-related disruption to printed books and in-person training in the quarter. Offsetting that was strong growth in key strategic areas, including Open Access publishing, research content usage, online student enrollment and digital courseware. The net result was that revenue rose 2%, adjusted EPS rose 124%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 42%. Organic revenue was down 1%.
I'll provide more detail on all of this in our segment discussions. The material earnings improvement this quarter was primarily driven by favorable revenue performance, particularly in Research, lower discretionary spending and savings from restructuring. Corporate expenses alone were down 16% or $7 million. Let's take a look at the segments.
Our research business continues to perform well. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA rose 6 and 19%, respectively. An important note is that about 4 million of our Q1 revenue came from journal subscription renewals that were delayed from Q4 due to COVID-19. That said, our strategies across the Research business continue to bear fruit.
Article output was up 13%. As you know, this is a key driver of our business models.  It's an outcome of good market growth, our strong publishing programs and our market-friendly publishing strategies. We continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth from our open access publishing program.
Our comprehensive national agreements in Europe are performing well with publishing volumes exceeding our expectations. Usage of the Wiley online library is growing strongly, up 10% over prior year. Our industry-leading society publishing program is having another great year. Net society wins will result in around $11 million of incremental publishing revenue in calendar '21.
In June, we signed a 10-year extension of our important Cochrane Library partnership. For reference, Cochrane is the world's preeminent collection of validated evidence for healthcare decision-makers. Our platform revenue rose 10% on new customer launches for Literatum. We continue to consolidate Literatum's industry-leading position in research content distribution, and our customer retention on a trailing 12-month basis was 98%.
Finally, we expanded our partnership with AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is one of the world's largest scientific societies. As part of this, we'll move the full suite of content from science, a globally celebrated family of journals, onto Literatum. This follows our recent announcement that we have also partnered with AAAS to grow their science career center.
I'll provide a bit of forward-looking color for each of our three segments. In research, our strong market position and diversified revenue streams are providing a solid foundation through this time of change. Calendar '20 subscription agreements are locked in through December of this year, and our calendar '21 renewal season just recently started. We do anticipate that COVID-related budget constraints at libraries will result in some price pressure for '21, but  It's too early to quantify.
In any case, we expect to offset this pressure through the continued strong growth of open access, research platforms and corporate solutions. At the same time, we continue to enhance our end-to-end workflows to improve efficiency and enhance the value proposition for researchers. We've made very good progress already, as evidenced in our strong EBITDA performance, reduced publishing cycle times and improved researcher engagement. In summary, we're seeing strong underlying indicators of future growth and long-term customer health.
In academic and professional learning, or APL, the story is an interesting one. The quarter was significantly affected by COVID due to the closure of bookstores, testing centers and corporate offices. Naturally, this affected the more traditional areas of APL, such as print book publishing, Test Prep services and in-person corporate training. The effect was that APL revenue declined 12, 13% organically, and adjusted EBITDA declined 23%.
But despite this short-term pressure, there's good news for the future in our KPIs. We're seeing quite positive trends in digital content and courseware as universities and companies pivot to virtual learning. We appear to be in an inflection point for digital content and digital courseware with record growth of 32 and 88%, respectively, on a pro forma basis. Our strategy to focus tightly on high-demand skills and careers is paying off.
In higher ed, we are gaining market share. Our share has grown from 4% in July 2018 to nearly 5% in July 2020 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our innovative zyBooks and Alta digital offerings are winning adoptions at an impressive pace. For example, zyBooks, our STEM platform, saw revenue double over the prior year, and it is winning consistently in large course adoptions.
So actually, I'm feeling good about the future of APL despite this quarter's COVID-19-related declines in our traditional business lines. For the remainder of the year, we expect that current trends will continue, namely that print book sales will continue to be challenged by COVID lockdowns and virtual learning. Note that print books represent a smaller portion of Wiley's overall business. Digital content and courseware will continue to grow strongly, helping to mitigate any potential decline this fall in higher ed enrollment.
Recovery in test prep will be dependent upon the reopening of testing sites and the resumption of certification exams. In corporate learning, we're seeing an acceleration of our virtual and hybrid corporate training products. We anticipate a strong post-pandemic recovery based upon what we are seeing in platform usage and new partner signings. Throughout APL, we're moving quickly to take advantage of the abrupt shift to digital learning by investing in our platforms and our go-to-market strategies.
This includes our value-driven business models that make content affordable. An example is our Inclusive Access program, which continues to grow very strongly. We are also responding to the moment by publishing timely titles on topics such as running businesses virtually and creating diverse, inclusive and equitable cultures. Finally, we're driving rapid and significant improvement in our cost structure to improve efficiency and our margin profile.
Our education services segment is positioned very well for this moment as universities, students and professionals are pivoting hard to both digital learning and online degrees. It will take time to fully realize the potential of this shift, but interest in our services, which help universities to succeed with online education, is running very high. For the quarter, revenue was up 29%, or 4% organically, and our EBITDA margin was 13%, which is up 9% for fiscal '20. Revenue growth was driven by $12 million of inorganic contribution from M3, as well as 9% growth in student enrollment.
Our mature and new programs are performing well, although organic growth was offset by small partner terminations as part of our continuous portfolio optimization. Our full-service partner count now stands at 67. We added two new full-service university partners in the quarter, the University of New Haven in Connecticut and Carlow University in Pennsylvania, and we signed additional universities for unbundled service agreements. Online program enrollment was very healthy this summer and remains so as we enter the fall semester.
At M3, we found the corporate demand for trained IT talent to be more stable in the pandemic than we had expected. Our existing customer base is solid, and we've begun placing new talent at several recently signed customers. Notably, we're gaining momentum in India where we are currently staffing a major new technology center for one of our global financial services clients. University services are facing significant pressures this year.
Universities are facing significant pressures this year as they simultaneously shift to hybrid and virtual learning while also dealing with financial shortfalls brought on by COVID-related enrollment declines. Although intermediate and long-term trends are very good, there is some near-term uncertainty to manage through with our clients. As with digital courseware, online education is now past the inflection point and is broadly adopted and accepted as a mainstream way to get a degree or certification. This was true before COVID, but the disruption of the past six months has driven home the value of high-quality, fairly priced education that can fit the life and career needs of the broad public.
This moment is reflected in enrollment trends and good pipeline of potential university partnerships, both in the U.S. and abroad and with our key partners, most of whom are evaluating online expansion opportunities. M3's IT talent placement volume is anticipated to be steady for the balance of the year as our corporate partners continue to maintain and grow their tech talent capacity. Major operational focus within education service is the continued improvement of the student journey from lead to enrollment.
These efforts continue to bear fruit in higher conversion rates and lower student acquisition costs. The business is well on track to realize its fiscal '22 goal of the 15% EBITDA margin. I'll now pass the call over to John to take you through our financial profile and optimization initiatives.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Brian. Despite a very challenging environment, we are generally pleased with our revenue and earnings performance for this quarter. That said, our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were unfavorable to prior year by $27 million and $20 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of changes in working capital. As a reminder, our cash flow is normally the use of cash in the first half of our fiscal year due to timing of collection for general subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
Capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, declined $6 million to $24 million for the quarter. As discussed on the last earnings call, we expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, with investment focused on new product and service capabilities, as well as process redesign and workflow automation. With respect to investment in acquisitions, we will remain opportunistic and continue our pursuit of attractive opportunities to add scale and provide enhanced tech-enabled products and services in both research and online education. In terms of our balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was up $117 million primarily due to acquisitions, but our interest expense was lower by $1.5 million as we realized the benefit of the lower interest rate environment.
Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.0 times, inclusive of all acquisitions. In terms of access to capital, we reported $101 million of cash on hand, and we ended the quarter with undrawn revolving credit of $650 million. Our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity afford us the flexibility to continue investing, acquiring and returning cash to shareholders. In June, the company modestly increased its quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.
Our current dividend yield is more than 4%. As a reminder, due to the economic downturn, we have refrained from repurchasing shares. We remain fully confident in our continued strategic momentum, cash generation and liquidity position, and we expect to resume share repurchases as the economic environment recovers. We are moving quickly on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the economic downturn and improve our agility and efficiency.
These programs are companywide and include optimizing our content development workflows, streamlining our customer support operations and achieving benchmark efficiency levels for corporate support functions, such as HR and finance. Meanwhile, we continue to maintain tight controls on discretionary spending across the company, and we have realized significant savings on travel, marketing events and professional fees. In addition, hiring and salary increases have been strictly limited to critical business needs and investment in our top performers. And in June, the executive leadership team and the board unanimously agreed to take six-month pay cuts ranging from 15% to 30%.
And as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a $15 million restructuring charge for actions that will generate annual run rate savings of approximately $30 million. Additional cost savings actions are anticipated in the current fiscal year. As an example, we are taking actions to rationalize our real estate portfolio given our successful transition to a virtual work environment. We will update you on our progress as the anticipated savings -- and the anticipated savings we will make throughout the year.
In summary, we are very well positioned to navigate the COVID-related challenges ahead while investing in key optimization and growth initiatives. As a reminder, given our limited visibility in the current economic environment, we have suspended our practice of providing annual guidance. We expect to return to providing guidance when the economic environment becomes more stable and our visibility improves. I'll now pass the call back to Brian.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. So, to recap the main messages for today, our business remains strong through the pandemic with good momentum continuing in both research and education services. We're experiencing COVID-related disruptions to print books and in-person training. Of course, this represents a smaller part of Wiley today, with nearly 80% of our revenue coming from digital products and tech-enabled services.
Core trends remain favorable in Wiley's key strategic areas of focus, such as peer-reviewed research, online education, digital content and courseware. We're taking full advantage of this unusual moment to drive improvement in the cost structure and core functioning of Wiley, focusing on high potential areas, such as our content development workflows, our management of the customer life cycle and the tuning of our real estate footprint for an increasingly virtual workforce. Overall, we're confident in the enduring importance of our Research and Education content, platforms and services. But more importantly, we're optimistic that this challenging moment -- at this challenging moment because we're seeing compelling evidence in our KPIs that our markets are strong and that our strategies are working.
To be specific, we're experiencing strong growth in demand to publish in our journals and consumer research, strong growth in Research platform signings, recurring revenue and content consumption with 98% client retention, strong growth in our digital courseware portfolio, strong growth in enrollment at our online degree programs and increased interest of universities in accelerating the transition to online education. So despite some near-term headwinds, the data tells me that we're tightly aligned with the current and long-term needs of our customers, the researchers, students, professors, administrators and corporate leaders that we serve worldwide. Once again, I want to thank our wonderful Wiley colleagues around the world for their grit, their positive spirit and their remarkable accomplishments this quarter. With that, I'll open the floor to your comments and questions.
Questions &amp; Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with research. Obviously, a really solid growth in a difficult environment.
How much of the jump in article output and content consumption would you contribute to COVID-related research? And as a follow-up, how much of the jump in research revenue and EBITDA reflects things like reprints and back files, open access? Just trying to get a sense for that relative to maybe the kind of legacy Research business, if you will.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start, and John can chip in. So, we're seeing -- definitely seeing good momentum in Research publishing. The COVID crisis has definitely increased the interest in -- or the output of researchers, and we see no signs of that declining.
With respect to specific COVID-related research, we certainly are publishing more COVID-related papers, as you would expect. But as a percentage of our total,  It's a very small percentage.  It's really a much broader --  It's a much broader increase in demand that we're seeing at this point in time that's coming across the portfolio. And to answer your second question, a large portion of that is coming in open access.
So, we're seeing really good growth rates in our open access pay-to-publish models, which, as you know, is a price times quantity model. So, when that happens, that translates directly into our revenue base. So we're definitely feeling consistent and increasing demand. And the practices that we've taken in the marketplace, which have been very market friendly, we believe, are leading researchers to choose Wiley and choose our journal.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Indeed. And on OA specifically, is it more article output from the same customers? More interest from new parties? How would you sort of weigh those two?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you know, in Open Access, the researchers themselves are deciding where to submit their articles. And as they do, they're choosing the titles, meaning the journal titles, and the publishers that they want to work with. So, increasingly,  It's almost a B2C model in that case. And so, things like the reputation, the quality of the customer experience, the researcher experience as they go through the publishing process, the speed with which the article gets out and the quality with which it gets promoted are what drives that.
So, we believe that we're seeing researchers choose us, quite simply stated. If that answers your question, Dan. If I didn't answer it specifically, please follow up.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
No, that helps. Absolutely. Maybe one or two quick follow-ups. The -- given the growth in OA, if we were to break down Research between kind of annual contracted revenue versus more variable or consumption-based, what would that look like at this stage percentage-wise?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, currently, as you look at our -- go ahead, John. Yes.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
I'll answer this in a way that is also responsive, Dan, to your question about what was the composition of revenue in the quarter. Roughly speaking, about 80% of our revenue comes from the combination of subscriptions and open access. And within that, call it, 70% of our research publishing business is subscription and about 10% of it is OA. The remaining 20% of our business, Dan, is, frankly, largely products and services that are derivatives of articles that are published under subscription, such as reprints that you mentioned and such as corporate advertising.
So, that's roughly the split of revenue that we have today. And of course, the subscription base is largely contracted, right? So that's well in play, but we're coming up on a renewal season. You asked whether -- you asked about are there significant backhaul revenues or such in the quarter, and the answer to that is no. This was a pretty normal quarter for us in terms of the composition of products and services that drove our revenue.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
That's helpful because that can be really high margin. One more, and I'll jump out. But you alluded, Brian, to obviously the extraordinary pressures that universities will be facing. Given where the stock is and has been trading, I think there's a lot more fear out there than -- well, may or may not warranted, we'll see.
But I know you don't want to get into the guidance, but when you think about Research, is there a range -- I guess, one, how are those initial dialogues going for calendar '21? And two, is there a range of revenue growth that you might be able to -- at an extreme high, extreme low bracket to sort of rein in some of the fears out there? Maybe  It's too early, but I thought I'd give you the opportunity.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah, look, I mean,  It's a completely fair question, and  It's what we want to know as well. We're talking to our customers very, very closely, and we're trying to get a sense of it. But  It's really early in the renewal season, and so it really is too early to tell.
We do expect some price pressure. But we expect that that price pressure should be offset by this strong growth that you're seeing in OA and in platforms and other areas. So, the simple answer is  It's too early to tell but that we believe that the price pressure we face will be modest and that it will be largely offset, if not more than offset, by our open access growth.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
OK. Helpful. I'll follow up with -- jump back in queue with any follow-up.

Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, Brian, historically, when GDP has fallen and unemployment has risen, enrollment trends have accelerated. And listening to your preamble, it doesn't sound like that's what you're seeing or anticipating for the fall semester, but just want to get more detail around that.
And then, on a related note, the 4% organic growth for Ed Services that you reported in the quarter, is that indicative of what we should anticipate for the balance of fiscal '21? And then, I have a follow-up.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Got it. So, from the perspective of the demand patterns in higher ed, this -- there's no question that there is a relationship between GDP, unemployment and college enrollment. That -- historically, that relationship has been one with a bit of a lag, a 12 to 18-month lag. And so, we do expect that to play out here, and we believe we're already seeing it in our leads, in our interest and in our enrollment.
But really, traditionally, that's played out over time. What's happening now in enrollment is different than that, though. What's happening now is literally a practical preclusion on universities from running schools as they normally had and a depression or a downward pressure on enrollment that's come from health fears related to being in large groups of people, as everybody knows. So, what we're seeing -- the enrollment pressure we're seeing is not some sort of an inverse relationship to the tradition.
In fact,  It's a novel pressure. And that novel pressure was expected in the fall to be in the neighborhood of 10 or 15%. We think it could be on the lower end of that. But from Wiley's perspective, and this is really important, from Wiley's perspective, our -- and that has -- that, by the way, will affect our principal sales.
But from Wiley's perspective, our strategic growth areas are digital courseware and online education, and those run counter to the trends that we're seeing in the market because if you can't go to school in person, you go online. Or if you're supposed to -- if you're usually in a classroom, but now you're going to be studying from home in a virtual environment, you have no choice but to get the digital materials. You can't share. You can't -- a book is not going to help because you need to be in the courseware.
So, that is contributing to an upswell in the parts of that business that we are strategically focused on in the future. So both in the services business, where we're focused on online enrollment, and in the courseware business or the content business, where we're focused on digital content and courseware, we actually believe that this is a material change that will have a long-term benefit for the business. Then answering second part of your question, we are seeing -- obviously, results are backward-looking. And in the spring, we definitely saw some shock to the system from COVID that affected enrollments.
It just -- this is not surprising. But over this summer, we started to see elevated levels of interest in our -- in lead generation and in conversion, leading to pretty good enrollment trend. So, our enrollment actually was up around 9% recently, and then we should see some of that continue. But again, we're just getting into the semester.
We'll just see exactly how this start goes. And so, we're not at all pessimistic. Quite the contrary, we're optimistic about where that business is going and the enrollment trends due to the things that I've been talking about, both the short-term shift to online translating into a greater acceptance of online learning and online education where it is really is the norm now in many cases for a large portion of people getting postsecondary educations, and then followed by what we expect to be a significant, economically driven increase in interest in education due to the inverse relationship that you identified before between the economy and enrollment in schools.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Got it. OK. Very helpful. And then, I know you spent a lot of time talking about open access, and it, obviously, had a very good quarter.
Just any updated thoughts around the sustainability of that growth? And then, separately, John, can you address the timing-related working capital issues that impacted your cash flow during the quarter?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll pick up the OA question first. We're -- long before COVID, we were seeing significantly greater volumes of submissions and consequent volumes of our output. That has continued and increase through COVID-19.
We see no reason to believe that  It's not going to continue. There might be a slight elevation now that's related to researchers being at home and finishing up papers. You think that would've been done already, and yet the elevated levels continue, and in fact, they're increasing. So, we're very bullish on those volumes levels continuing at a high level on a go-forward basis.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
And then, Drew, on your question with respect to cash flow and, in particular, the impact of working capital that I referenced in my comments, which were the biggest drivers. I mean, by the way, we had very strong performance in the quarter from a real earnings growth perspective, but then working capital played against us. And in particular, I would note that our cash collections associated with journals were pretty strong and in line with our expectations, so we're feeling good about collections there. We do have some customers that have requested extended terms, but  It's not a material impact to our results, and we feel like that's flowing well.
The most significant impact on the timing of working capital has to do with payables. In the March -- late March and April time frame, like others, we went into a bit of cash conservation mode given potential risks around liquidity in the market at that point in time. And so, we put some pressure on payables at that time. And then, as things began to ease up in our first quarter, we also eased up on payables.
So, the ground that we gave up on cash flow in the quarter is particularly concentrated around payables, and  It's just sort of the normal flow back to a balance after conserving cash at the end of the fourth quarter.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
OK. All right guys appreciate it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Sami Kassab with Exane.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my questions, I have three of them, please. The first one is on a topic that I think you've just touched on, but I would kindly like you to perhaps elaborate a little bit more.
On open access, what's the risk that the elevated levels of submissions that we've seen actually reflect the fact that scientists have been locked down at home and away from their labs and had a lot of time to write papers but had no ability to make progress on their scientific research and that those three, four months will actually, six months, 12 months down the road, will lead to a slowdown in open access growth as science did not really happen through the lockdowns? Secondly, on China, we've seen the Chinese government communicate new research appraisal policies, pushing Chinese scientists to publish more into Chinese local language journals, [Inaudible] moving away from splicing. Do you think the China policy and regulatory changes may have an impact, or is that too small to matter? Is that not something that is big on your radar screen? Then lastly, can you elaborate a little bit on how you see the regulatory environment in OPM? We've had the likes of Bob Sherman and Senator Warren look at OPM. Do you think the regulatory environment could be at risk of changing? Or do you think  It's a solid regime that you have today and you have no major concerns on the regulatory front for OPM?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you very much for asking three questions, each of which is a dissertation. So, I'll take them one at a time. They're very good questions, excellent questions that I'd be asking if I were you. So the first one, on the risk of the elevated level of OA sort of bringing back to some lower level later, we are now six or more months into this pandemic; seven or eight, depending on where you're looking in the world.
We continue to see elevated levels. We continue to see researchers putting out papers. Researchers are going back into the labs, absolutely. And so, we're -- we expect it to continue at some level.
Could it come back a little bit? Of course, it could. We're at a very high level right now. But I will remind you that trends in research are very, very positive in terms of overall increasing volume of output in the marketplace. So, in other words, we see mid to high-single-digit increases in the volume of papers every year.
And that long preceded the environment. We consider that will continue in the future. The second thing is that the research continues to be something that is funded at a very high level. In countries around the world, we see no we see no signs of that declining.
So, yeah, I mean, there's no question that there could be a little bit of an artificial increase, but those artificial -- those increases have continued for quite some time now. The final thing I'd say on that is we believe that our publishing program and our approach to publishing is extremely researcher and market friendly, and we think we're getting more than our fair share of submissions. I'll also remind you that of all the submissions we get, we publish a very small portion of them, and so there's always increasing potential there. So, no, I don't see a snapback or a rebound that goes the wrong way on us in the future.
Now, the question of China, another really good question. China is a super important market in the future of research. China is a very important producer and consumer of research. China represents around 5% of our research publishing business now.
So, from a business perspective,  It's not going to swing us one way or the other in any given quarter, but it is very important in the long run, and we are -- and the increasing discussion in China about their endemic -- or indigenous publishing is certainly an important move and important trend. But we have very, very close relationships in China. We have a very good connection to the government agencies and so forth there, and we continue to stay very close to them. Chinese researchers want their journals to be in the best journals in the world so that they can get the recognition and the -- for their work that they desire, and we believe our publishing portfolio leads us there.
But also, we are increasingly partnering in China to make sure that we are seen as the publisher of choice. So, while there is some -- there's always some concern when there are discussions going on in places like China about changes in policy, we believe that, ultimately, we're very well positioned to capitalize on what is still continuing significant growth in both Chinese publishing and Chinese consumption. On the --

Sorry, may I squeeze in a follow-up before we move to OPM? In subscription unbundling and sub has seen some strong takeup, a third of R1 universities on unsub within less than a year. Do you see a trend or risk toward more unbundling of the big deals, especially in the U.S. as universities face budgetary pressure?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So, if the question is about unbundling and whether we are seeing more or we'll be seeing more, as universities face pressure, they certainly are looking for ways to save cost. I've said we can't really comment on what we expect that pricing pressure to be. But as we look into the market, we don't see a lot of evidence.
We see some one-off cases, but we don't see a lot of evidence of universities and university librarians saying we don't need that content, our researchers don't need it, we're not using it. So, to the extent that we have a high -- which we do, a very high-quality portfolio of journals that is essential to the success of research, we will continue to be purchased by those universities. I'll remind you that academics make their careers based upon research, and universities climb the rankings or to descend in the rankings based upon their positioning in the research ecosystem and both the volume and the quality of their output. So, research and research content is absolutely central to the success of our important clients.
So, while we may see some edge cases because, to be sure, there's pressure in the marketplace, we don't see any sort of any evidence of a large-scale trend toward unbundling. OK. And let me move toward OPM. So, the conversation about OPM has gone on for a long time, and the conversation about the revenue share model has gone on for a long period of time.
We start from the position that we have excellent relationships, long-term relationships with our universities, and we help those universities fundamentally to succeed. We help them to succeed by providing extremely high-quality programs, by attracting students and by matriculating those students at extremely high completion rates, higher completion rates than typically they see in their on-ground programs. So, insofar as we are doing that, we are helping those universities to succeed. There has long been a conversation about the revenue share model.
Our clients seem to be fine with it. Now, to be sure, there will be some movement in the marketplace there, and therefore, Wiley has adopted again, as we always do, very market friendly practices of working with universities on terms that they believe are fair. And we have our bundled revenue share model businesses, we have our fee-for-service businesses and so forth. So, we believe wherever the market goes, we're going to be fine.
Having said that, we participate very closely in the discussions that go on in Washington and elsewhere on the future of education, generally speaking, and on the future of of higher ed and its relationship with service providers. So, we've responded to the various inquiries. They have been ongoing. We expect them to continue to be ongoing.
But we're very close to it, and we are not -- our confidence in the future is based upon the fact that we're in a consensual relationship, if you call it, with our partners, who are getting a tremendous amount out of it. If we, together, or if they decide they want to go in a different direction, we're very happy to go in a different direction with them, and we always have been. So we don't view it as a major threat.  It's something to be talked about,  It's something to be studied,  It's something to be adapted to.
But we are confident in our position and, more importantly, the position and the quality of the services and the value of the services that we provide to the marketplace.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
This is fantastic and all very convincing. You said in your opening remarks that you had higher completion rates. Did you mean that your OPM program has higher completion rate than equivalent on-campus programs have?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Typically speaking, our programs -- I will say, our programs have very high completion rates for the students that start and those that complete the program. I'll remind you that, historically, when the industry has come under pressure, it has been for universities and education providers that have had extremely low completion rates, such that students started but they never finished and, therefore, never got value for the education that they paid for or that somebody else, such as the government or the taxpayer, paid for. That is absolutely not the case in our programs. The completion rates are extremely high, and our clients are happy with them.
And, clearly, students are happy with them because they're staying through to completion and achieving career outcomes that perpetuate the demand for the product.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen. Prior to COVID, rearing its ugly head, margins were eroding. Was that from your conversion from hard copy to digital, or did it relate to state cutbacks in education?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
John, do you want to pick that up?
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, just generally, looking back over fiscal year '20, we did see some erosion of our margin. I would say that the most significant drivers behind that erosion of margin were two. One was the rapid -- continued rapid decline of print, which has reasonably good margins.
But print, as we know, is in decline, and that rate of decline got a bit faster in the past fiscal year and had an impact on our bottom line. We're taking actions, as we discussed in today's review, to improve the profitability of that business by focusing and by, in particular, focusing our future on digital courseware and digital content. The second factor that contributed overall to the shift in the blended margin of the business, there's an increased component of our revenue coming from OPM business that we just talked about. And we recognize that in its current state, the market itself in its current state that operating margins are low.
But we've been emphasizing that we are balancing between top line growth, which is very important to us, and improving profitability there. And we said that we would drive that business to 15% EBITDA margin by next year, and we're well on the march to get there. But those are the two factors that have been putting pressure on our margin, and both of them are being addressed.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
If going forward, there are continued high levels of unemployment, is that a tailwind in that there's a tendency for enrollments in school to go up in that kind of macroeconomic environment?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I'll pick that back up, John. As I was indicating earlier, there is a long term -- and in fact, I think it was either Dan or Drew that pointed it out, there is a long-term established pattern of when the economy goes down and unemployment goes up, that people go back to school. That relationship is typically a lagged relationship, meaning it happens not instantly, it happens 12 to 18 months later, and we do expect to see that.
But we have other tailwinds that are hitting us right now, which is simply that people can't go to school in person. They're physically precluded from going to school fully in person. And so, therefore, we have elevated levels of interest from potential students in taking education in an online world. It also is providing a tailwind, as I indicated earlier, to our digital courseware businesses, which, as I indicated in my remarks, are seeing record increases in usage and adoption because again, if you're not in a physical setting, you need a learning management system based product, something that -- where your teacher can make assignments, where you can do homework, where you can get the content predictably, the content that the teacher needs, not have to Google for your curriculum.
And physical books just aren't as good in those environments. They don't do all those things. And so, there's a significant tailwind that hits you in that sense. And, again, as I indicated, the -- we believe that these are accelerations of long-term trends so that it won't be a short-term blip.
We believe that we're going to see continued elevation of those levels, which is completely -- all of these trends that I'm talking about are completely in sync and aligned with our strategy that we've been working on for the last few years. And  It's gratifying to see it start to come to fruition at a time when the world needs both education and research more than ever.

336,kj@mentedcosmetics.com,"With $4 billion in sales in 12 months and a rosy forecast ahead, lipstick manufacturers were smiling at the end of 2019, and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing face masks and an unstable economy. With no end to the crisis in sight, brands large and small have had to adjust manufacturing, advertising, and social media on the fly. The results, they say, are paying off — and may mark the beginning of profound changes for the cosmetics industry.
Beyond changes in everyday demand for lip color, some businesses have found themselves re-examining everything from their supply chain up. E.L.F. Beauty, a mass-market brand founded in 2004, reacted to the pandemic earlier than most, according to Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer, because it sources its products abroad. It made changes in early January — weeks before Western countries entered lockdown — when its operation in China was impacted. It has managed to adjust and keep customers supplied, but has noticed a shift in what people are buying. 
Lipstick has slid, most likely because people cared less about the colors of their lips when they're all having to wear masks and the economic fallout of lockdown, but sales of other items rose to pick up the slack.
""We saw a surge in the market around bronzer and brow, so we swiftly deployed assets and messaging to accelerate E.L.F. bronzers and brow products,"" Marchisotto says. ""As we continue navigating through COVID-19, we closely monitor consumer signals and learn that they don't just change monthly or weekly during this crisis. They can change daily or even hourly.""
These shifts are happening across the industry. A May report from McKinsey, the consultancy giant, found cosmetics sales had dropped 55% among prestige brands. ""When consumers do return to work, many will continue to wear masks, further slowing makeup's recovery,"" the report said. However, the report noted that sales of skin-, nail- and hair-care products in Europe had quadrupled, as more people pampered themselves at home — and a September report from market research firm NPD found that more women in the US were using facial skincare products than in 2019.
This constant adjustment has been particularly challenging for independent brands, which may not have the cash or infrastructure to absorb huge drops in sales or swings in their inventory. For Mented, a growing, Black-owned brand with a dedicated following for its highly-pigmented color cosmetics, the pandemic has proved challenging — but surprising, in a good way.
Cofounder Amanda E. Johnson says: ""We were planning on having a great 2020 and then March hit. It was slow in the beginning for everybody, because COVID shook the world and no one knew what was going on. So, we thought, 'oh, we're going to have a horrible year like everyone else.'""
The company adjusted its forecast down 40% and braced for disaster, but was shocked when April's sales figures came in. ""We were like, ""Oh my God, this is the biggest month in the history of the company. It must be an anomaly."" It wasn't. Sales are actually trending up and projections have been readjusted.
Amanda E. Johnson, cofounder and COO of Mented Cosmetics.

Johnson says the fact the business has always been online only helped — as did its focus on people of color. She also believes that lipstick, despite rising mask-wearing, is finding its place in the pandemic with two very different kinds of consumers. ""One, there's the professional that's working from home. So, if she is working from home, she's on Zoom and Team and Google Hangout calls all day long"" and secondly, ""the essential worker. So, we've asked, why are you still putting on lipstick every day? And what we've heard back is, because 'I need something to make me feel good right now.'""
Marchisotto agrees, predicting the business will keep promoting beauty as an important element of self-care in a difficult time. One nurse wrote to the company saying its primer had changed her life — this kind of direct feedback is important at a time when all historical models of trends are obsolete. ""It was another moment for us to understand the power of our products. We don't just sell beauty."" 
While the path forward is still unclear, Johnson is beginning to think that marketing products as an indulgence could prove successful. ""Women are definitely still buying makeup in droves,"" she says, but adds that the difference is ""they want brands to tell them that they're doing the right thing.""
It remains to be seen which platforms are best for telling buyers that. TikTok, Home Shopping Network, and Instagram have all shown good results for these brands. The message is clearly one consumers want to hear. ""Historically, color cosmetics has been a 'recession-proof product,'"" Johnson said. ""And I think what we're seeing is, in some ways, it is also pandemic proof.""",,

330,matt@logrocket.com,"In an unprecedented year that saw many teams shift to remote working, we asked tech and business leaders to pick their essential tools.
Throughout our Leaders Insights series on Siliconrepublic.com last year, we asked a host of tech and business leaders from Ireland and further afield to name the essential tools and resources that get them through the working week.
In a year that brought major disruption to most of our working lives, they turned to video conferencing, collaboration software and a whole lot of coffee.
Handy hardware
The move away from offices means many of us are now relying on tech devices for both work and keeping in touch. Seán Keating of Vilicom said his number-one tool is his smartphone. Its like the Swiss army knife of business tools. It keeps me on schedule, navigates to meetings, runs all our most important business apps, connects my laptop to our IT cloud, enables our Teams communications and more.
HPs Gary Tierney said that his phone and laptop are the must-have items for work, but since the arrival of Covid-19 he has been relying more on his laptop. Ive found that working from home has put an even greater emphasis on the criticality of my PC as a communication tool and a general workhorse.
Many people also had to figure out a new at-home work set-up last year. I recently invested in a 38-inch ultra-wide monitor and its been a game changer for me, Joe Lennon of Workvivo told us over the summer.
Video conferencing
2020 was the year we all became very familiar with Zoom (as well as Zoombombing and Zoom fatigue).
Amy Bunszel of Autodesk said she now spends most of her day on Zoom, and Patrick Horgan of Horizon8 said tools such as Zoom are proving incredibly helpful in the work-from-home dynamic.
But there are plenty of other alternatives out there. Microsoft Teams was highlighted as an essential daily tool by plenty of people, including SL Controls Keith Moran, CWSIs Ronan Murphy and Avanades Graham Healy.
Martin McKay of Texthelp said he couldnt be without the Google Meet and Chat tools at the moment, and Xilinxs Brendan Farley said Skype and Webex are other options being used for video calls.
Online collaboration tools are integral to not just our success but our basic functioning, added Ogie Sheehy of ViClarity. Whether it is Zoom or GoToMeeting, Google Chat or Microsoft Teams, these tools are enabling us to continue to work uninterrupted across a global footprint. 
Software saviours
While Microsoft Teams has seen a sharp rise in users in the past year, many companies have been relying on other products from the Microsoft 365 stack. Ronan Murphy of CWSI said these tools allow his company to do whatever we need to do from wherever we are.
SoftwareOnes Una Keeshan said she uses the focus plan in Microsoft MyAnalytics to set aside time for priority work, while Avanades Graham Healy said he uses Microsoft Dynamics for customer relationship management and Power BI for reporting, forecasting and analytics.
With teams dispersed, messaging and collaboration tools such as Slack also came to the fore. Its a convenient way to collaborate over projects and to organise ourselves according to different topics and business functions, said Oz Alashe of CybSafe.
Collaboration tools have always been important for developers. Joe Lennon of Workvivo said GitHub is fundamental for his engineering team to manage source code and code reviews, and they regularly use Tuple to do remote pair programming.
Jennifer Sethre of Intry said Intercom and LogRocket are important tools for her HR tech company, and Keith Moran of SL Controls turns to the Frankli platform for engaging with his team.
Lettertecs Frank Kelly uses Google Keep for jotting quick notes down as they occur, while ViClaritys Ogie Sheehy is a fan of the voice dictation app on his iPhone. It allows me to be immediately responsive to important emails that come through when I am out and about and away from my desk, he said.
A good old-fashioned to-do list
While there may be a fancy tech tool for everything, many leaders still rely on a simple to-do list to keep focused. Nessa McEniff of Learnovate said listing her priorities is a key part of the week and shes a bit of an obsessive list maker.
Netssos Brian ODoherty added that a having a clear list keeps him grounded. I set myself a weekly list and find that its a great way of keeping the faith in myself, my work and my ambitions, he said.
But Liz Cunningham of Google said she is still looking for the perfect tool that will manage all her to-do lists across personal and work life to help keep all the balls in the air.
PayPals Annette Hickey noted that her calendar helps keep her focused throughout the week, and Dells Jason Ward said an organised calendar is key to ensuring I am as productive as possible.
Keeping the mind clear
The sudden shift to remote working means that many have had to find new ways to focus, while still maintaining a good work-life balance and not overworking now that your kitchen may be your office.
To help with this, Nicole Sahin of Globalization Partners said she keeps Fridays free of Zoom meetings. Its like heaven to have that time to think and get things done.
Similarly, Codemas Donna Gartland said that, since the shift to working from home, she now blocks time in her calendar each week without meetings to focus and get deep work done. I use distraction blockers across all my devices, she added, such as Stay Focusd on my browser and Focus mode on Pixel.
Xilinxs Brendan Farley said he removed the work email app from his phone many years ago, which helps him switch off in the evenings. And Mark Cockerill of ServiceNow suggested having a great Spotify playlist on hand.
Getting away from the desk
For minding mental and physical health, many other leaders also suggested getting out and about. SL Controls Keith Moran enjoys a good game of squash in the evening, Arkphires Paul Nannetti tries to run on the beach a few times a week, and Fenergos Louise OConnell said that yoga or a walk in the fresh air can help to just clear the mind.
Una Keeshan of SoftwareOne has recently taken tennis back up as a hobby. The tennis is not only great exercise, she said, but also helps me clear my head from work or the stresses of the day.
And Autodesks Amy Bunszel said that, now she doesnt have a commute for the time being, its a bit easier to make time for exercise every morning and a nice dinner in the evening.
Food certainly plays a key part in the day for many. Horizon8s Patrick Horgan said the barbecue has proved an essential tool for bringing his family together in the current environment.
And one of the essential tools to get Dells Jason Ward through the week? Coffee, coffee and more coffee.",,

318,zook@horizontech.com,"LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Turning Point Brands, Inc. (TPB) (NYSE: TPB), a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of branded consumer products with active ingredients, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020.
Results at a Glance
Third Quarter 2020
(Comparisons vs. same period year-ago)
<ul><li>
Net sales increased 7.6% to $104.2 million;
</li><li>
Gross profit increased 12.8% to $48.3 million;
</li><li>
Net income increased $1.5 million to $7.8 million despite PMTA costs incurred during the current quarter;
</li><li>
Adjusted EBITDA increased 27.4% to $23.9 million (see Schedule A for a reconciliation to net income);
</li><li>
Diluted EPS of $0.40 and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.75 as compared to $0.31 and $0.61 in the year-ago period, respectively (see Schedule B for a reconciliation to Diluted EPS);
</li></ul>
Streamlining and repositioning the business at the end of 2019 has paid dividends throughout 2020. Smokeless saw continued same store sales momentum in MST and newfound strength in loose leaf chewing tobacco. Smoking (Zig-Zag) saw its highest growth rate in recent history driven by product and channel growth initiatives behind rolling papers, the benefits of greater control of our MYO cigar wraps business after the Durfort transaction closed in the second quarter, and a burgeoning e-commerce presence. The NewGen segment navigated admirably through significant market disruption caused by the PMTA application deadline, said Larry Wexler, President and CEO. Overall, we are seeing ongoing benefits from re-shaping our business towards a more growth-oriented mindset and are able to raise our outlook once again for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Recent Events
As detailed in a separate press release, TPB today announced a $15 million strategic investment in leading global cannabinoid company dosist and an exclusive co-development and distribution agreement of a new national CBD brand, created in partnership with dosists thc-free business unit. Additionally, TPB has an option to invest another $15 million at pre-determined terms within the next 12 months. TPB has been issued a warrant to receive preferred shares of dosist that will automatically be exercised upon a change in federal laws in the United States to reschedule or deschedule cannabis and/or permit its general cultivation, distribution and possession. As part of this agreement, TPB will also have an option to fill a seat on the board of directors of dosist upon legalization.
On October 5, 2020, TPB announced the acquisition of a 20% stake in Wild Hempettes LLC (Wild Hempettes), a leading manufacturer of hemp cigarettes under the WildHemp and Hempettes brands, with options to increase its stake to a 100% ownership position based on certain milestones. As part of the transaction, TPB will be the exclusive distributor of Hempettes to U.S. bricks and mortar retailers.
On October 1, 2020, TPB sold the assets of its remaining owned retail stores in Oklahoma. As consideration for the transaction, TPB will receive a royalty from the acquiror, while also receiving rights to market and test products in the stores on a quarterly basis. Year-to-date sales and gross profit for those stores was $2.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively. This transaction continues our efforts to streamline the NewGen segment, as part of our announcement in the fourth quarter 2019 for the exploration of strategic alternatives for the third-party vaping distribution business.
On September 8, 2020, TPB announced it had submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Premarket Tobacco Applications (PMTAs) covering 250 products, an important and necessary step for TPB to offer adult consumers an extensive portfolio of products that serve as alternatives to combustible cigarettes and satisfy a wide variety of consumer preferences. The PMTAs covered a broad assortment of products in the vapor category including multiple proprietary e-liquid offerings in varying nicotine strengths, technologies and sizes; proprietary replacement parts and components of open system tank devices through partnerships with two leading manufacturers for exclusive distribution of products in the United States; and a closed system e-cigarette. The PMTAs provided clarity to customers and retail partners of TPBs continued support behind products across multiple leading brands including Solace, VaporFi®, South Beach Smoke, HorizonTech®, FreeMaX® and other developing brands and partnerships.
Smokeless Products Segment (29% of total net sales in the quarter)
For the third quarter, Smokeless products net sales increased 13.7% to $29.8 million on double-digit growth of MST and loose leaf chewing tobacco. MST represented 59% of Smokeless revenues in the quarter, up from 58% a year earlier. In the quarter, total Smokeless segment volume increased 10.3% and price/mix advanced 3.4%.
MST continued to gain market momentum driven by strong same store sales growth despite a tough comparable. The outlook continues to be bright for this product line with increasing consumer acceptance and further distribution gains, said Graham Purdy, Chief Operating Officer. Our loose leaf chewing tobacco business saw accelerated growth during the quarter as targeted selling initiatives that began earlier in the year led to meaningful year-over-year market share growth according to MSAi.
For the quarter, Smokeless segment gross profit increased 18.1% to $16.0 million. Segment gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 53.9% primarily as a result of strong incremental margin contribution of MST.
Smoking Products Segment (34% of total net sales in the quarter)
For the third quarter, net sales of Smoking products increased 19.0% to $36.0 million. Growth was driven by double-digit advances in US rolling papers and MYO cigar wraps. This more than offset a $2.0 million decline in our Canadian papers business which compared against an inventory load-in during last years third quarter. Non-focus cigars and MYO pipe declined $0.3 million. In the quarter, total Smoking segment volume increased 18.0% while price/mix increased 1.0%.
This segment of the business is benefitting from new product introductions and channel-specific sales efforts that are expanding market share and better aligning our growth to cannabis consumption trends. While increased consumption related to COVID-19 benefitted our US rolling papers business, we were encouraged to see our volumes grow significantly above the industry growth rate during the quarter. Our emerging e-commerce business demonstrated strong progress with sales roughly doubling from the previous quarter, said Purdy. In addition, post-the Durfort transaction, we now have a stronger and more direct working relationship with our MYO cigar wrap manufacturer which is enabling us to ramp production better to align with consumer demand.
For the quarter, Smoking products gross profit increased 27.9% to $21.3 million. Segment gross margin expanded 410 basis points to 59.1% as a result of increased US rolling paper sales and increased margin in MYO cigar sales as a result of the Durfort transaction.
NewGen (New Generation) Products Segment (37% of total net sales in the quarter)
For the third quarter, NewGen segment net sales decreased 4.8% to $38.4 million. Flat performance in our vape distribution business and double-digit growth from Solace and other Nu-X products was offset by a decline in RipTide which compared against a trade load-in during its launch in the prior year period.
Our NewGen business performed in-line with our expectations as the business managed through a challenging competitive environment created by the PMTA deadline with competitors liquidating inventories in anticipation of exiting the market. The recent sale of the remaining Vapor Shark stores continues the streamlining of the segment, said Purdy. While we still expect short-term disruption related to the PMTA process to impact our fourth quarter, the extensive portfolio of products submitted through the PMTA process has us increasingly optimistic about our outlook going forward as the market consolidates.
For the quarter, NewGen gross profit decreased 12.8% to $11.0 million. Segment gross margin decreased 260 basis points to 28.6% primarily due to temporary pricing pressure as competitors liquidated inventories and inventory reserves. Third quarter 2020 included $2.3 million of tariff expense compared to $2.6 million a year-ago.
Other Events and Performance Measures in the Third Quarter
Third quarter consolidated selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $32.3 million compared to $29.8 million in 2019 with the increase primarily due to non-recurring PMTA-related expenses incurred during the quarter as detailed below.
The third quarter had notable non-recurring impacts:
<ul><li>
$5.3 million of FDA PMTA-related expenses as compared to $0.2 million in the year-ago period; and
</li><li>
$0.6 million of transaction expenses principally related to M&amp;A activity as compared to $0.5 million in the year-ago period.
</li></ul>
The third quarter also included a $1.2 million non-cash charge within net periodic costs related to the termination of our defined benefit pension plan in 2019. We received net $1.7 million of cash related to the termination of the plan.
Total gross debt as of September 30, 2020, was $328.0 million. The corresponding net debt (total gross debt less cash) at September 30, 2020 was $260.6 million. The company ended the quarter with total liquidity of $113.8 million comprising $67.4 million of cash and $46.4 million of revolving credit facility capacity.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 82,097 shares at an average price of $28.95.
2020 Outlook Update
Taking into account the strength we have seen thus far this year and expected near-term volatility within our NewGen segment, we revise our guidance provided on July 28, 2020 as follows:
Absent any further acquisitions, the company projects 2020 net sales to be $395 to $401 million (up from previous guidance of $370 to $382 million). We project 2020 Adjusted EBITDA of $87 million to $90 million (up from previous guidance of $78 to $83 million).
Stock compensation and non-cash incentive expense in 2020 is projected to be $2.8 million.
The company spent a total of $16.6 million on the PMTA process, in-line with previous guidance of $16 to $18 million. This is inclusive of $2.2 million spent in 2019 and $14.4 million in the first three quarters of 2020.
Cash interest expense is projected to be $12 million and GAAP interest expense includes $7 million of debt discount amortization equal to the fair value of the equity components over the expected life of the 2024 convertible notes.
The company expects the 2020 effective income tax rate to be 23% to 24%.
Capital expenditures for 2020 are anticipated to be approximately $6 million (up from previous guidance of $4 to $6 million) as we have accelerated certain capital expenditure projects due to temporary tax code incentives.
Net Sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 are expected to be $95 to $101 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, we use non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, and Adjusted Operating Income. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, and Adjusted Operating Income are used by management to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes and are presented to our board of directors. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS and Adjusted Operating Income are appropriate measures of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance.
We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, other non-cash items and other items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define Adjusted diluted EPS as diluted earnings per share excluding items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define Adjusted Operating Income as operating income excluding depreciation, amortization, LIFO, other non-cash items and other items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance.
Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted diluted EPS and Adjusted Operating Income exclude significant expenses that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements and is subject to inherent limitations. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate this non-U.S. GAAP measure differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided, in the supplemental information attached, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the next directly comparable GAAP measures.

Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Wiley's vice president of investor relations, Brian Campbell. Please go ahead.
Brian Campbell -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter 2021 earnings update. On the call with me are Brian Napack, president and chief executive officer; and John Kritzmacher, chief financial officer. A few reminders to start.
The call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. You shouldn't rely on these statements, as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our SEC filings. The company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Wiley provides non-GAAP measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends.
These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under GAAP. Please see the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures presented in the supplementary information included in our press release. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency, unless otherwise specified.
After the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. I'll now turn the call over to Wiley's president and CEO, Brian Napack. 
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Right now, educators and students around the world are heading back to school and researchers are heading back into their labs in a world significantly altered by COVID-19. As they do, they're rewriting the playbooks for education and research. From our vantage point,  It's clear that they're turning to digital content, platforms and services at unprecedented levels, and they're also turning to corporate partners, such as Wiley, who can help them achieve their goals in a changed world.
The result for Wiley is that across the company, demand for our digital products and services has grown markedly. This unusual moment is moving our markets and proving that the strategies that we have been pursuing are not only right for the market today, they are right for where the market is going in the long term. We had a solid first quarter of revenue and earnings performance despite the disrupted environment. This demonstrated both resilience of our business and tight alignment of our strategies with the market's evolving needs.
We'll talk specifics about our performance shortly, but  It's important to note that today's acute health, economic and social problems serve to reinforce the value of Wiley's mission. Over the past months, we've moved faster to validate and publish more research and have made thousands of critical COVID-related research studies freely available. We've helped many universities, schools and corporations around the world to more quickly migrate from traditional to virtual learning. And we spent lots of time in our communities, raised money for causes that address injustice and taking concrete actions to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion within Wiley.
We continue to be reminded of the racial inequality plaguing our society and the need for corporate citizens, such as us, to play an active role in dismantling it. Our global team takes great pride in the fact that their work is truly helping the world to heal, recover, and thrive. Wiley today remains largely in work-from-home mode, although we have partially opened a few offices around the world where local health conditions allow. I want to recognize the great work of our team in executing at a very high level through this challenging period.
Simply stated, the team continues to deliver on our key milestones and customer commitments. In regular surveys, the vast majority of our colleagues report feeling productive and happy, and their engagement is very high. This can be attributed to our strong mission-driven culture, our tech-enabled workflows and our consistent emphasis on colleague care. The pandemic continues to disrupt the global economy, and this has directly impacted some of our more traditional revenue sources, such as physical books and in person training.
But despite these focused headwinds, we're very encouraged by the underlying momentum we're seeing in education and research. This momentum should continue well beyond the pandemic. We've been talking for some time about the positive trends that are driving research and education. Our growth strategy is built on these trends.
I'm pleased to see that they are accelerating at this moment and that Wiley is capitalizing on them. Research output is rising rapidly. Demand for online education and for the digital courseware to support it is also rising rapidly. The acceleration in these areas speaks well to our long-term outlook.
Internally, we are using the moment to lean into our operational excellence. This includes a focus on improving content workflows, our customer journeys our facilities' footprint and more. John will talk about this later, but there is much we have done and much that we continue to do to improve the efficiency of operations. With that, let me summarize the first quarter's results.
As I said, we continue to see COVID-related disruption to printed books and in-person training in the quarter. Offsetting that was strong growth in key strategic areas, including Open Access publishing, research content usage, online student enrollment and digital courseware. The net result was that revenue rose 2%, adjusted EPS rose 124%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 42%. Organic revenue was down 1%.
I'll provide more detail on all of this in our segment discussions. The material earnings improvement this quarter was primarily driven by favorable revenue performance, particularly in Research, lower discretionary spending and savings from restructuring. Corporate expenses alone were down 16% or $7 million. Let's take a look at the segments.
Our research business continues to perform well. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA rose 6 and 19%, respectively. An important note is that about 4 million of our Q1 revenue came from journal subscription renewals that were delayed from Q4 due to COVID-19. That said, our strategies across the Research business continue to bear fruit.
Article output was up 13%. As you know, this is a key driver of our business models.  It's an outcome of good market growth, our strong publishing programs and our market-friendly publishing strategies. We continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth from our open access publishing program.
Our comprehensive national agreements in Europe are performing well with publishing volumes exceeding our expectations. Usage of the Wiley online library is growing strongly, up 10% over prior year. Our industry-leading society publishing program is having another great year. Net society wins will result in around $11 million of incremental publishing revenue in calendar '21.
In June, we signed a 10-year extension of our important Cochrane Library partnership. For reference, Cochrane is the world's preeminent collection of validated evidence for healthcare decision-makers. Our platform revenue rose 10% on new customer launches for Literatum. We continue to consolidate Literatum's industry-leading position in research content distribution, and our customer retention on a trailing 12-month basis was 98%.
Finally, we expanded our partnership with AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is one of the world's largest scientific societies. As part of this, we'll move the full suite of content from science, a globally celebrated family of journals, onto Literatum. This follows our recent announcement that we have also partnered with AAAS to grow their science career center.
I'll provide a bit of forward-looking color for each of our three segments. In research, our strong market position and diversified revenue streams are providing a solid foundation through this time of change. Calendar '20 subscription agreements are locked in through December of this year, and our calendar '21 renewal season just recently started. We do anticipate that COVID-related budget constraints at libraries will result in some price pressure for '21, but  It's too early to quantify.
In any case, we expect to offset this pressure through the continued strong growth of open access, research platforms and corporate solutions. At the same time, we continue to enhance our end-to-end workflows to improve efficiency and enhance the value proposition for researchers. We've made very good progress already, as evidenced in our strong EBITDA performance, reduced publishing cycle times and improved researcher engagement. In summary, we're seeing strong underlying indicators of future growth and long-term customer health.
In academic and professional learning, or APL, the story is an interesting one. The quarter was significantly affected by COVID due to the closure of bookstores, testing centers and corporate offices. Naturally, this affected the more traditional areas of APL, such as print book publishing, Test Prep services and in-person corporate training. The effect was that APL revenue declined 12, 13% organically, and adjusted EBITDA declined 23%.
But despite this short-term pressure, there's good news for the future in our KPIs. We're seeing quite positive trends in digital content and courseware as universities and companies pivot to virtual learning. We appear to be in an inflection point for digital content and digital courseware with record growth of 32 and 88%, respectively, on a pro forma basis. Our strategy to focus tightly on high-demand skills and careers is paying off.
In higher ed, we are gaining market share. Our share has grown from 4% in July 2018 to nearly 5% in July 2020 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our innovative zyBooks and Alta digital offerings are winning adoptions at an impressive pace. For example, zyBooks, our STEM platform, saw revenue double over the prior year, and it is winning consistently in large course adoptions.
So actually, I'm feeling good about the future of APL despite this quarter's COVID-19-related declines in our traditional business lines. For the remainder of the year, we expect that current trends will continue, namely that print book sales will continue to be challenged by COVID lockdowns and virtual learning. Note that print books represent a smaller portion of Wiley's overall business. Digital content and courseware will continue to grow strongly, helping to mitigate any potential decline this fall in higher ed enrollment.
Recovery in test prep will be dependent upon the reopening of testing sites and the resumption of certification exams. In corporate learning, we're seeing an acceleration of our virtual and hybrid corporate training products. We anticipate a strong post-pandemic recovery based upon what we are seeing in platform usage and new partner signings. Throughout APL, we're moving quickly to take advantage of the abrupt shift to digital learning by investing in our platforms and our go-to-market strategies.
This includes our value-driven business models that make content affordable. An example is our Inclusive Access program, which continues to grow very strongly. We are also responding to the moment by publishing timely titles on topics such as running businesses virtually and creating diverse, inclusive and equitable cultures. Finally, we're driving rapid and significant improvement in our cost structure to improve efficiency and our margin profile.
Our education services segment is positioned very well for this moment as universities, students and professionals are pivoting hard to both digital learning and online degrees. It will take time to fully realize the potential of this shift, but interest in our services, which help universities to succeed with online education, is running very high. For the quarter, revenue was up 29%, or 4% organically, and our EBITDA margin was 13%, which is up 9% for fiscal '20. Revenue growth was driven by $12 million of inorganic contribution from M3, as well as 9% growth in student enrollment.
Our mature and new programs are performing well, although organic growth was offset by small partner terminations as part of our continuous portfolio optimization. Our full-service partner count now stands at 67. We added two new full-service university partners in the quarter, the University of New Haven in Connecticut and Carlow University in Pennsylvania, and we signed additional universities for unbundled service agreements. Online program enrollment was very healthy this summer and remains so as we enter the fall semester.
At M3, we found the corporate demand for trained IT talent to be more stable in the pandemic than we had expected. Our existing customer base is solid, and we've begun placing new talent at several recently signed customers. Notably, we're gaining momentum in India where we are currently staffing a major new technology center for one of our global financial services clients. University services are facing significant pressures this year.
Universities are facing significant pressures this year as they simultaneously shift to hybrid and virtual learning while also dealing with financial shortfalls brought on by COVID-related enrollment declines. Although intermediate and long-term trends are very good, there is some near-term uncertainty to manage through with our clients. As with digital courseware, online education is now past the inflection point and is broadly adopted and accepted as a mainstream way to get a degree or certification. This was true before COVID, but the disruption of the past six months has driven home the value of high-quality, fairly priced education that can fit the life and career needs of the broad public.
This moment is reflected in enrollment trends and good pipeline of potential university partnerships, both in the U.S. and abroad and with our key partners, most of whom are evaluating online expansion opportunities. M3's IT talent placement volume is anticipated to be steady for the balance of the year as our corporate partners continue to maintain and grow their tech talent capacity. Major operational focus within education service is the continued improvement of the student journey from lead to enrollment.
These efforts continue to bear fruit in higher conversion rates and lower student acquisition costs. The business is well on track to realize its fiscal '22 goal of the 15% EBITDA margin. I'll now pass the call over to John to take you through our financial profile and optimization initiatives.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Brian. Despite a very challenging environment, we are generally pleased with our revenue and earnings performance for this quarter. That said, our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were unfavorable to prior year by $27 million and $20 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of changes in working capital. As a reminder, our cash flow is normally the use of cash in the first half of our fiscal year due to timing of collection for general subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
Capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, declined $6 million to $24 million for the quarter. As discussed on the last earnings call, we expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, with investment focused on new product and service capabilities, as well as process redesign and workflow automation. With respect to investment in acquisitions, we will remain opportunistic and continue our pursuit of attractive opportunities to add scale and provide enhanced tech-enabled products and services in both research and online education. In terms of our balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was up $117 million primarily due to acquisitions, but our interest expense was lower by $1.5 million as we realized the benefit of the lower interest rate environment.
Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.0 times, inclusive of all acquisitions. In terms of access to capital, we reported $101 million of cash on hand, and we ended the quarter with undrawn revolving credit of $650 million. Our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity afford us the flexibility to continue investing, acquiring and returning cash to shareholders. In June, the company modestly increased its quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.
Our current dividend yield is more than 4%. As a reminder, due to the economic downturn, we have refrained from repurchasing shares. We remain fully confident in our continued strategic momentum, cash generation and liquidity position, and we expect to resume share repurchases as the economic environment recovers. We are moving quickly on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the economic downturn and improve our agility and efficiency.
These programs are companywide and include optimizing our content development workflows, streamlining our customer support operations and achieving benchmark efficiency levels for corporate support functions, such as HR and finance. Meanwhile, we continue to maintain tight controls on discretionary spending across the company, and we have realized significant savings on travel, marketing events and professional fees. In addition, hiring and salary increases have been strictly limited to critical business needs and investment in our top performers. And in June, the executive leadership team and the board unanimously agreed to take six-month pay cuts ranging from 15% to 30%.
And as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a $15 million restructuring charge for actions that will generate annual run rate savings of approximately $30 million. Additional cost savings actions are anticipated in the current fiscal year. As an example, we are taking actions to rationalize our real estate portfolio given our successful transition to a virtual work environment. We will update you on our progress as the anticipated savings -- and the anticipated savings we will make throughout the year.
In summary, we are very well positioned to navigate the COVID-related challenges ahead while investing in key optimization and growth initiatives. As a reminder, given our limited visibility in the current economic environment, we have suspended our practice of providing annual guidance. We expect to return to providing guidance when the economic environment becomes more stable and our visibility improves. I'll now pass the call back to Brian.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. So, to recap the main messages for today, our business remains strong through the pandemic with good momentum continuing in both research and education services. We're experiencing COVID-related disruptions to print books and in-person training. Of course, this represents a smaller part of Wiley today, with nearly 80% of our revenue coming from digital products and tech-enabled services.
Core trends remain favorable in Wiley's key strategic areas of focus, such as peer-reviewed research, online education, digital content and courseware. We're taking full advantage of this unusual moment to drive improvement in the cost structure and core functioning of Wiley, focusing on high potential areas, such as our content development workflows, our management of the customer life cycle and the tuning of our real estate footprint for an increasingly virtual workforce. Overall, we're confident in the enduring importance of our Research and Education content, platforms and services. But more importantly, we're optimistic that this challenging moment -- at this challenging moment because we're seeing compelling evidence in our KPIs that our markets are strong and that our strategies are working.
To be specific, we're experiencing strong growth in demand to publish in our journals and consumer research, strong growth in Research platform signings, recurring revenue and content consumption with 98% client retention, strong growth in our digital courseware portfolio, strong growth in enrollment at our online degree programs and increased interest of universities in accelerating the transition to online education. So despite some near-term headwinds, the data tells me that we're tightly aligned with the current and long-term needs of our customers, the researchers, students, professors, administrators and corporate leaders that we serve worldwide. Once again, I want to thank our wonderful Wiley colleagues around the world for their grit, their positive spirit and their remarkable accomplishments this quarter. With that, I'll open the floor to your comments and questions.
Questions &amp; Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with research. Obviously, a really solid growth in a difficult environment.
How much of the jump in article output and content consumption would you contribute to COVID-related research? And as a follow-up, how much of the jump in research revenue and EBITDA reflects things like reprints and back files, open access? Just trying to get a sense for that relative to maybe the kind of legacy Research business, if you will.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start, and John can chip in. So, we're seeing -- definitely seeing good momentum in Research publishing. The COVID crisis has definitely increased the interest in -- or the output of researchers, and we see no signs of that declining.
With respect to specific COVID-related research, we certainly are publishing more COVID-related papers, as you would expect. But as a percentage of our total,  It's a very small percentage.  It's really a much broader --  It's a much broader increase in demand that we're seeing at this point in time that's coming across the portfolio. And to answer your second question, a large portion of that is coming in open access.
So, we're seeing really good growth rates in our open access pay-to-publish models, which, as you know, is a price times quantity model. So, when that happens, that translates directly into our revenue base. So we're definitely feeling consistent and increasing demand. And the practices that we've taken in the marketplace, which have been very market friendly, we believe, are leading researchers to choose Wiley and choose our journal.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Indeed. And on OA specifically, is it more article output from the same customers? More interest from new parties? How would you sort of weigh those two?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you know, in Open Access, the researchers themselves are deciding where to submit their articles. And as they do, they're choosing the titles, meaning the journal titles, and the publishers that they want to work with. So, increasingly,  It's almost a B2C model in that case. And so, things like the reputation, the quality of the customer experience, the researcher experience as they go through the publishing process, the speed with which the article gets out and the quality with which it gets promoted are what drives that.
So, we believe that we're seeing researchers choose us, quite simply stated. If that answers your question, Dan. If I didn't answer it specifically, please follow up.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
No, that helps. Absolutely. Maybe one or two quick follow-ups. The -- given the growth in OA, if we were to break down Research between kind of annual contracted revenue versus more variable or consumption-based, what would that look like at this stage percentage-wise?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, currently, as you look at our -- go ahead, John. Yes.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
I'll answer this in a way that is also responsive, Dan, to your question about what was the composition of revenue in the quarter. Roughly speaking, about 80% of our revenue comes from the combination of subscriptions and open access. And within that, call it, 70% of our research publishing business is subscription and about 10% of it is OA. The remaining 20% of our business, Dan, is, frankly, largely products and services that are derivatives of articles that are published under subscription, such as reprints that you mentioned and such as corporate advertising.
So, that's roughly the split of revenue that we have today. And of course, the subscription base is largely contracted, right? So that's well in play, but we're coming up on a renewal season. You asked whether -- you asked about are there significant backhaul revenues or such in the quarter, and the answer to that is no. This was a pretty normal quarter for us in terms of the composition of products and services that drove our revenue.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
That's helpful because that can be really high margin. One more, and I'll jump out. But you alluded, Brian, to obviously the extraordinary pressures that universities will be facing. Given where the stock is and has been trading, I think there's a lot more fear out there than -- well, may or may not warranted, we'll see.
But I know you don't want to get into the guidance, but when you think about Research, is there a range -- I guess, one, how are those initial dialogues going for calendar '21? And two, is there a range of revenue growth that you might be able to -- at an extreme high, extreme low bracket to sort of rein in some of the fears out there? Maybe  It's too early, but I thought I'd give you the opportunity.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah, look, I mean,  It's a completely fair question, and  It's what we want to know as well. We're talking to our customers very, very closely, and we're trying to get a sense of it. But  It's really early in the renewal season, and so it really is too early to tell.
We do expect some price pressure. But we expect that that price pressure should be offset by this strong growth that you're seeing in OA and in platforms and other areas. So, the simple answer is  It's too early to tell but that we believe that the price pressure we face will be modest and that it will be largely offset, if not more than offset, by our open access growth.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
OK. Helpful. I'll follow up with -- jump back in queue with any follow-up.
Operator
Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, Brian, historically, when GDP has fallen and unemployment has risen, enrollment trends have accelerated. And listening to your preamble, it doesn't sound like that's what you're seeing or anticipating for the fall semester, but just want to get more detail around that.
And then, on a related note, the 4% organic growth for Ed Services that you reported in the quarter, is that indicative of what we should anticipate for the balance of fiscal '21? And then, I have a follow-up.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Got it. So, from the perspective of the demand patterns in higher ed, this -- there's no question that there is a relationship between GDP, unemployment and college enrollment. That -- historically, that relationship has been one with a bit of a lag, a 12 to 18-month lag. And so, we do expect that to play out here, and we believe we're already seeing it in our leads, in our interest and in our enrollment.
But really, traditionally, that's played out over time. What's happening now in enrollment is different than that, though. What's happening now is literally a practical preclusion on universities from running schools as they normally had and a depression or a downward pressure on enrollment that's come from health fears related to being in large groups of people, as everybody knows. So, what we're seeing -- the enrollment pressure we're seeing is not some sort of an inverse relationship to the tradition.
In fact,  It's a novel pressure. And that novel pressure was expected in the fall to be in the neighborhood of 10 or 15%. We think it could be on the lower end of that. But from Wiley's perspective, and this is really important, from Wiley's perspective, our -- and that has -- that, by the way, will affect our principal sales.
But from Wiley's perspective, our strategic growth areas are digital courseware and online education, and those run counter to the trends that we're seeing in the market because if you can't go to school in person, you go online. Or if you're supposed to -- if you're usually in a classroom, but now you're going to be studying from home in a virtual environment, you have no choice but to get the digital materials. You can't share. You can't -- a book is not going to help because you need to be in the courseware.
So, that is contributing to an upswell in the parts of that business that we are strategically focused on in the future. So both in the services business, where we're focused on online enrollment, and in the courseware business or the content business, where we're focused on digital content and courseware, we actually believe that this is a material change that will have a long-term benefit for the business. Then answering second part of your question, we are seeing -- obviously, results are backward-looking. And in the spring, we definitely saw some shock to the system from COVID that affected enrollments.
It just -- this is not surprising. But over this summer, we started to see elevated levels of interest in our -- in lead generation and in conversion, leading to pretty good enrollment trend. So, our enrollment actually was up around 9% recently, and then we should see some of that continue. But again, we're just getting into the semester.
We'll just see exactly how this start goes. And so, we're not at all pessimistic. Quite the contrary, we're optimistic about where that business is going and the enrollment trends due to the things that I've been talking about, both the short-term shift to online translating into a greater acceptance of online learning and online education where it is really is the norm now in many cases for a large portion of people getting postsecondary educations, and then followed by what we expect to be a significant, economically driven increase in interest in education due to the inverse relationship that you identified before between the economy and enrollment in schools.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Got it. OK. Very helpful. And then, I know you spent a lot of time talking about open access, and it, obviously, had a very good quarter.
Just any updated thoughts around the sustainability of that growth? And then, separately, John, can you address the timing-related working capital issues that impacted your cash flow during the quarter?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll pick up the OA question first. We're -- long before COVID, we were seeing significantly greater volumes of submissions and consequent volumes of our output. That has continued and increase through COVID-19.
We see no reason to believe that  It's not going to continue. There might be a slight elevation now that's related to researchers being at home and finishing up papers. You think that would've been done already, and yet the elevated levels continue, and in fact, they're increasing. So, we're very bullish on those volumes levels continuing at a high level on a go-forward basis.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
And then, Drew, on your question with respect to cash flow and, in particular, the impact of working capital that I referenced in my comments, which were the biggest drivers. I mean, by the way, we had very strong performance in the quarter from a real earnings growth perspective, but then working capital played against us. And in particular, I would note that our cash collections associated with journals were pretty strong and in line with our expectations, so we're feeling good about collections there. We do have some customers that have requested extended terms, but  It's not a material impact to our results, and we feel like that's flowing well.
The most significant impact on the timing of working capital has to do with payables. In the March -- late March and April time frame, like others, we went into a bit of cash conservation mode given potential risks around liquidity in the market at that point in time. And so, we put some pressure on payables at that time. And then, as things began to ease up in our first quarter, we also eased up on payables.
So, the ground that we gave up on cash flow in the quarter is particularly concentrated around payables, and  It's just sort of the normal flow back to a balance after conserving cash at the end of the fourth quarter.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
OK. All right guys appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Sami Kassab with Exane.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my questions, I have three of them, please. The first one is on a topic that I think you've just touched on, but I would kindly like you to perhaps elaborate a little bit more.
On open access, what's the risk that the elevated levels of submissions that we've seen actually reflect the fact that scientists have been locked down at home and away from their labs and had a lot of time to write papers but had no ability to make progress on their scientific research and that those three, four months will actually, six months, 12 months down the road, will lead to a slowdown in open access growth as science did not really happen through the lockdowns? Secondly, on China, we've seen the Chinese government communicate new research appraisal policies, pushing Chinese scientists to publish more into Chinese local language journals, [Inaudible] moving away from splicing. Do you think the China policy and regulatory changes may have an impact, or is that too small to matter? Is that not something that is big on your radar screen? Then lastly, can you elaborate a little bit on how you see the regulatory environment in OPM? We've had the likes of Bob Sherman and Senator Warren look at OPM. Do you think the regulatory environment could be at risk of changing? Or do you think  It's a solid regime that you have today and you have no major concerns on the regulatory front for OPM?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you very much for asking three questions, each of which is a dissertation. So, I'll take them one at a time. They're very good questions, excellent questions that I'd be asking if I were you. So the first one, on the risk of the elevated level of OA sort of bringing back to some lower level later, we are now six or more months into this pandemic; seven or eight, depending on where you're looking in the world.
We continue to see elevated levels. We continue to see researchers putting out papers. Researchers are going back into the labs, absolutely. And so, we're -- we expect it to continue at some level.
Could it come back a little bit? Of course, it could. We're at a very high level right now. But I will remind you that trends in research are very, very positive in terms of overall increasing volume of output in the marketplace. So, in other words, we see mid to high-single-digit increases in the volume of papers every year.
And that long preceded the environment. We consider that will continue in the future. The second thing is that the research continues to be something that is funded at a very high level. In countries around the world, we see no we see no signs of that declining.
So, yeah, I mean, there's no question that there could be a little bit of an artificial increase, but those artificial -- those increases have continued for quite some time now. The final thing I'd say on that is we believe that our publishing program and our approach to publishing is extremely researcher and market friendly, and we think we're getting more than our fair share of submissions. I'll also remind you that of all the submissions we get, we publish a very small portion of them, and so there's always increasing potential there. So, no, I don't see a snapback or a rebound that goes the wrong way on us in the future.
Now, the question of China, another really good question. China is a super important market in the future of research. China is a very important producer and consumer of research. China represents around 5% of our research publishing business now.
So, from a business perspective,  It's not going to swing us one way or the other in any given quarter, but it is very important in the long run, and we are -- and the increasing discussion in China about their endemic -- or indigenous publishing is certainly an important move and important trend. But we have very, very close relationships in China. We have a very good connection to the government agencies and so forth there, and we continue to stay very close to them. Chinese researchers want their journals to be in the best journals in the world so that they can get the recognition and the -- for their work that they desire, and we believe our publishing portfolio leads us there.
But also, we are increasingly partnering in China to make sure that we are seen as the publisher of choice. So, while there is some -- there's always some concern when there are discussions going on in places like China about changes in policy, we believe that, ultimately, we're very well positioned to capitalize on what is still continuing significant growth in both Chinese publishing and Chinese consumption. On the --
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Sorry, may I squeeze in a follow-up before we move to OPM? In subscription unbundling and sub has seen some strong takeup, a third of R1 universities on unsub within less than a year. Do you see a trend or risk toward more unbundling of the big deals, especially in the U.S. as universities face budgetary pressure?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So, if the question is about unbundling and whether we are seeing more or we'll be seeing more, as universities face pressure, they certainly are looking for ways to save cost. I've said we can't really comment on what we expect that pricing pressure to be. But as we look into the market, we don't see a lot of evidence.
We see some one-off cases, but we don't see a lot of evidence of universities and university librarians saying we don't need that content, our researchers don't need it, we're not using it. So, to the extent that we have a high -- which we do, a very high-quality portfolio of journals that is essential to the success of research, we will continue to be purchased by those universities. I'll remind you that academics make their careers based upon research, and universities climb the rankings or to descend in the rankings based upon their positioning in the research ecosystem and both the volume and the quality of their output. So, research and research content is absolutely central to the success of our important clients.
So, while we may see some edge cases because, to be sure, there's pressure in the marketplace, we don't see any sort of any evidence of a large-scale trend toward unbundling. OK. And let me move toward OPM. So, the conversation about OPM has gone on for a long time, and the conversation about the revenue share model has gone on for a long period of time.
We start from the position that we have excellent relationships, long-term relationships with our universities, and we help those universities fundamentally to succeed. We help them to succeed by providing extremely high-quality programs, by attracting students and by matriculating those students at extremely high completion rates, higher completion rates than typically they see in their on-ground programs. So, insofar as we are doing that, we are helping those universities to succeed. There has long been a conversation about the revenue share model.
Our clients seem to be fine with it. Now, to be sure, there will be some movement in the marketplace there, and therefore, Wiley has adopted again, as we always do, very market friendly practices of working with universities on terms that they believe are fair. And we have our bundled revenue share model businesses, we have our fee-for-service businesses and so forth. So, we believe wherever the market goes, we're going to be fine.
Having said that, we participate very closely in the discussions that go on in Washington and elsewhere on the future of education, generally speaking, and on the future of of higher ed and its relationship with service providers. So, we've responded to the various inquiries. They have been ongoing. We expect them to continue to be ongoing.
But we're very close to it, and we are not -- our confidence in the future is based upon the fact that we're in a consensual relationship, if you call it, with our partners, who are getting a tremendous amount out of it. If we, together, or if they decide they want to go in a different direction, we're very happy to go in a different direction with them, and we always have been. So we don't view it as a major threat.  It's something to be talked about,  It's something to be studied,  It's something to be adapted to.
But we are confident in our position and, more importantly, the position and the quality of the services and the value of the services that we provide to the marketplace.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
This is fantastic and all very convincing. You said in your opening remarks that you had higher completion rates. Did you mean that your OPM program has higher completion rate than equivalent on-campus programs have?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Typically speaking, our programs -- I will say, our programs have very high completion rates for the students that start and those that complete the program. I'll remind you that, historically, when the industry has come under pressure, it has been for universities and education providers that have had extremely low completion rates, such that students started but they never finished and, therefore, never got value for the education that they paid for or that somebody else, such as the government or the taxpayer, paid for. That is absolutely not the case in our programs. The completion rates are extremely high, and our clients are happy with them.
And, clearly, students are happy with them because they're staying through to completion and achieving career outcomes that perpetuate the demand for the product.

Our next question comes from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen. Prior to COVID, rearing its ugly head, margins were eroding. Was that from your conversion from hard copy to digital, or did it relate to state cutbacks in education?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
John, do you want to pick that up?
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, just generally, looking back over fiscal year '20, we did see some erosion of our margin. I would say that the most significant drivers behind that erosion of margin were two. One was the rapid -- continued rapid decline of print, which has reasonably good margins.
But print, as we know, is in decline, and that rate of decline got a bit faster in the past fiscal year and had an impact on our bottom line. We're taking actions, as we discussed in today's review, to improve the profitability of that business by focusing and by, in particular, focusing our future on digital courseware and digital content. The second factor that contributed overall to the shift in the blended margin of the business, there's an increased component of our revenue coming from OPM business that we just talked about. And we recognize that in its current state, the market itself in its current state that operating margins are low.
But we've been emphasizing that we are balancing between top line growth, which is very important to us, and improving profitability there. And we said that we would drive that business to 15% EBITDA margin by next year, and we're well on the march to get there. But those are the two factors that have been putting pressure on our margin, and both of them are being addressed.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
If going forward, there are continued high levels of unemployment, is that a tailwind in that there's a tendency for enrollments in school to go up in that kind of macroeconomic environment?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I'll pick that back up, John. As I was indicating earlier, there is a long term -- and in fact, I think it was either Dan or Drew that pointed it out, there is a long-term established pattern of when the economy goes down and unemployment goes up, that people go back to school. That relationship is typically a lagged relationship, meaning it happens not instantly, it happens 12 to 18 months later, and we do expect to see that.
But we have other tailwinds that are hitting us right now, which is simply that people can't go to school in person. They're physically precluded from going to school fully in person. And so, therefore, we have elevated levels of interest from potential students in taking education in an online world. It also is providing a tailwind, as I indicated earlier, to our digital courseware businesses, which, as I indicated in my remarks, are seeing record increases in usage and adoption because again, if you're not in a physical setting, you need a learning management system based product, something that -- where your teacher can make assignments, where you can do homework, where you can get the content predictably, the content that the teacher needs, not have to Google for your curriculum.
And physical books just aren't as good in those environments. They don't do all those things. And so, there's a significant tailwind that hits you in that sense. And, again, as I indicated, the -- we believe that these are accelerations of long-term trends so that it won't be a short-term blip.
We believe that we're going to see continued elevation of those levels, which is completely -- all of these trends that I'm talking about are completely in sync and aligned with our strategy that we've been working on for the last few years. And  It's gratifying to see it start to come to fruition at a time when the world needs both education and research more than ever.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Great. Thank you for taking my questions I appreciate it.
Operator
And I'm not showing any further questions at this time and would like to turn the call back over to our host for any closing remarks.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, that's me, the host. Thank you very much all for joining us today, and we'll look forward to reviewing our second-quarter results in December. Wish you all good luck and good health, and we'll see you soon.

303,kj@mentedcosmetics.com,"With $4 billion in sales in 12 months and a rosy forecast ahead, lipstick manufacturers were smiling at the end of 2019, and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing face masks and an unstable economy. With no end to the crisis in sight, brands large and small have had to adjust manufacturing, advertising, and social media on the fly. The results, they say, are paying off — and may mark the beginning of profound changes for the cosmetics industry.
Beyond changes in everyday demand for lip color, some businesses have found themselves re-examining everything from their supply chain up. E.L.F. Beauty, a mass-market brand founded in 2004, reacted to the pandemic earlier than most, according to Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer, because it sources its products abroad. It made changes in early January — weeks before Western countries entered lockdown — when its operation in China was impacted. It has managed to adjust and keep customers supplied, but has noticed a shift in what people are buying. 
Lipstick has slid, most likely because people cared less about the colors of their lips when they're all having to wear masks and the economic fallout of lockdown, but sales of other items rose to pick up the slack.
""We saw a surge in the market around bronzer and brow, so we swiftly deployed assets and messaging to accelerate E.L.F. bronzers and brow products,"" Marchisotto says. ""As we continue navigating through COVID-19, we closely monitor consumer signals and learn that they don't just change monthly or weekly during this crisis. They can change daily or even hourly.""
These shifts are happening across the industry. A May report from McKinsey, the consultancy giant, found cosmetics sales had dropped 55% among prestige brands. ""When consumers do return to work, many will continue to wear masks, further slowing makeup's recovery,"" the report said. However, the report noted that sales of skin-, nail- and hair-care products in Europe had quadrupled, as more people pampered themselves at home — and a September report from market research firm NPD found that more women in the US were using facial skincare products than in 2019.
This constant adjustment has been particularly challenging for independent brands, which may not have the cash or infrastructure to absorb huge drops in sales or swings in their inventory. For Mented, a growing, Black-owned brand with a dedicated following for its highly-pigmented color cosmetics, the pandemic has proved challenging — but surprising, in a good way.
Cofounder Amanda E. Johnson says: ""We were planning on having a great 2020 and then March hit. It was slow in the beginning for everybody, because COVID shook the world and no one knew what was going on. So, we thought, 'oh, we're going to have a horrible year like everyone else.'""
The company adjusted its forecast down 40% and braced for disaster, but was shocked when April's sales figures came in. ""We were like, ""Oh my God, this is the biggest month in the history of the company. It must be an anomaly."" It wasn't. Sales are actually trending up and projections have been readjusted.
Amanda E. Johnson, cofounder and COO of Mented Cosmetics.
Mented Cosmetics
Johnson says the fact the business has always been online only helped — as did its focus on people of color. She also believes that lipstick, despite rising mask-wearing, is finding its place in the pandemic with two very different kinds of consumers. ""One, there's the professional that's working from home. So, if she is working from home, she's on Zoom and Team and Google Hangout calls all day long"" and secondly, ""the essential worker. So, we've asked, why are you still putting on lipstick every day? And what we've heard back is, because 'I need something to make me feel good right now.'""
Marchisotto agrees, predicting the business will keep promoting beauty as an important element of self-care in a difficult time. One nurse wrote to the company saying its primer had changed her life — this kind of direct feedback is important at a time when all historical models of trends are obsolete. ""It was another moment for us to understand the power of our products. We don't just sell beauty."" 
While the path forward is still unclear, Johnson is beginning to think that marketing products as an indulgence could prove successful. ""Women are definitely still buying makeup in droves,"" she says, but adds that the difference is ""they want brands to tell them that they're doing the right thing.""
It remains to be seen which platforms are best for telling buyers that. TikTok, Home Shopping Network, and Instagram have all shown good results for these brands. The message is clearly one consumers want to hear. ""Historically, color cosmetics has been a 'recession-proof product,'"" Johnson said. ""And I think what we're seeing is, in some ways, it is also pandemic proof.""","I see that Mented Cosmetics had a rosy forecast ahead of 2019  and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit  bringing face masks and an unstable economy. With no end to the crisis in sight brands large and small have had to adjust manufacturing advertising and social media on the fly. How has this impacted Mented Cosmetics?",

John Wiley &amp; Sons (A Shares) (NYSE:JW-A)Q1 2021 Earnings CallSep 03, 2020, 10:00 a.m. ET
Contents:
<ul><li>Prepared Remarks</li><li>Questions and Answers</li><li>Call Participants</li></ul>Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Wiley's vice president of investor relations, Brian Campbell. Please go ahead.
Brian Campbell -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter 2021 earnings update. On the call with me are Brian Napack, president and chief executive officer; and John Kritzmacher, chief financial officer. A few reminders to start.
The call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. You shouldn't rely on these statements, as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our SEC filings. The company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Wiley provides non-GAAP measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends.
These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under GAAP. Please see the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures presented in the supplementary information included in our press release. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency, unless otherwise specified.
After the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. I'll now turn the call over to Wiley's president and CEO, Brian Napack. 
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Right now, educators and students around the world are heading back to school and researchers are heading back into their labs in a world significantly altered by COVID-19. As they do, they're rewriting the playbooks for education and research. From our vantage point,  It's clear that they're turning to digital content, platforms and services at unprecedented levels, and they're also turning to corporate partners, such as Wiley, who can help them achieve their goals in a changed world.
The result for Wiley is that across the company, demand for our digital products and services has grown markedly. This unusual moment is moving our markets and proving that the strategies that we have been pursuing are not only right for the market today, they are right for where the market is going in the long term. We had a solid first quarter of revenue and earnings performance despite the disrupted environment. This demonstrated both resilience of our business and tight alignment of our strategies with the market's evolving needs.
We'll talk specifics about our performance shortly, but  It's important to note that today's acute health, economic and social problems serve to reinforce the value of Wiley's mission. Over the past months, we've moved faster to validate and publish more research and have made thousands of critical COVID-related research studies freely available. We've helped many universities, schools and corporations around the world to more quickly migrate from traditional to virtual learning. And we spent lots of time in our communities, raised money for causes that address injustice and taking concrete actions to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion within Wiley.
We continue to be reminded of the racial inequality plaguing our society and the need for corporate citizens, such as us, to play an active role in dismantling it. Our global team takes great pride in the fact that their work is truly helping the world to heal, recover, and thrive. Wiley today remains largely in work-from-home mode, although we have partially opened a few offices around the world where local health conditions allow. I want to recognize the great work of our team in executing at a very high level through this challenging period.
Simply stated, the team continues to deliver on our key milestones and customer commitments. In regular surveys, the vast majority of our colleagues report feeling productive and happy, and their engagement is very high. This can be attributed to our strong mission-driven culture, our tech-enabled workflows and our consistent emphasis on colleague care. The pandemic continues to disrupt the global economy, and this has directly impacted some of our more traditional revenue sources, such as physical books and in person training.
But despite these focused headwinds, we're very encouraged by the underlying momentum we're seeing in education and research. This momentum should continue well beyond the pandemic. We've been talking for some time about the positive trends that are driving research and education. Our growth strategy is built on these trends.
I'm pleased to see that they are accelerating at this moment and that Wiley is capitalizing on them. Research output is rising rapidly. Demand for online education and for the digital courseware to support it is also rising rapidly. The acceleration in these areas speaks well to our long-term outlook.
Internally, we are using the moment to lean into our operational excellence. This includes a focus on improving content workflows, our customer journeys our facilities' footprint and more. John will talk about this later, but there is much we have done and much that we continue to do to improve the efficiency of operations. With that, let me summarize the first quarter's results.
As I said, we continue to see COVID-related disruption to printed books and in-person training in the quarter. Offsetting that was strong growth in key strategic areas, including Open Access publishing, research content usage, online student enrollment and digital courseware. The net result was that revenue rose 2%, adjusted EPS rose 124%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 42%. Organic revenue was down 1%.
I'll provide more detail on all of this in our segment discussions. The material earnings improvement this quarter was primarily driven by favorable revenue performance, particularly in Research, lower discretionary spending and savings from restructuring. Corporate expenses alone were down 16% or $7 million. Let's take a look at the segments.
Our research business continues to perform well. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA rose 6 and 19%, respectively. An important note is that about 4 million of our Q1 revenue came from journal subscription renewals that were delayed from Q4 due to COVID-19. That said, our strategies across the Research business continue to bear fruit.
Article output was up 13%. As you know, this is a key driver of our business models.  It's an outcome of good market growth, our strong publishing programs and our market-friendly publishing strategies. We continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth from our open access publishing program.
Our comprehensive national agreements in Europe are performing well with publishing volumes exceeding our expectations. Usage of the Wiley online library is growing strongly, up 10% over prior year. Our industry-leading society publishing program is having another great year. Net society wins will result in around $11 million of incremental publishing revenue in calendar '21.
In June, we signed a 10-year extension of our important Cochrane Library partnership. For reference, Cochrane is the world's preeminent collection of validated evidence for healthcare decision-makers. Our platform revenue rose 10% on new customer launches for Literatum. We continue to consolidate Literatum's industry-leading position in research content distribution, and our customer retention on a trailing 12-month basis was 98%.
Finally, we expanded our partnership with AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is one of the world's largest scientific societies. As part of this, we'll move the full suite of content from science, a globally celebrated family of journals, onto Literatum. This follows our recent announcement that we have also partnered with AAAS to grow their science career center.
I'll provide a bit of forward-looking color for each of our three segments. In research, our strong market position and diversified revenue streams are providing a solid foundation through this time of change. Calendar '20 subscription agreements are locked in through December of this year, and our calendar '21 renewal season just recently started. We do anticipate that COVID-related budget constraints at libraries will result in some price pressure for '21, but  It's too early to quantify.
In any case, we expect to offset this pressure through the continued strong growth of open access, research platforms and corporate solutions. At the same time, we continue to enhance our end-to-end workflows to improve efficiency and enhance the value proposition for researchers. We've made very good progress already, as evidenced in our strong EBITDA performance, reduced publishing cycle times and improved researcher engagement. In summary, we're seeing strong underlying indicators of future growth and long-term customer health.
In academic and professional learning, or APL, the story is an interesting one. The quarter was significantly affected by COVID due to the closure of bookstores, testing centers and corporate offices. Naturally, this affected the more traditional areas of APL, such as print book publishing, Test Prep services and in-person corporate training. The effect was that APL revenue declined 12, 13% organically, and adjusted EBITDA declined 23%.
But despite this short-term pressure, there's good news for the future in our KPIs. We're seeing quite positive trends in digital content and courseware as universities and companies pivot to virtual learning. We appear to be in an inflection point for digital content and digital courseware with record growth of 32 and 88%, respectively, on a pro forma basis. Our strategy to focus tightly on high-demand skills and careers is paying off.
In higher ed, we are gaining market share. Our share has grown from 4% in July 2018 to nearly 5% in July 2020 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our innovative zyBooks and Alta digital offerings are winning adoptions at an impressive pace. For example, zyBooks, our STEM platform, saw revenue double over the prior year, and it is winning consistently in large course adoptions.
So actually, I'm feeling good about the future of APL despite this quarter's COVID-19-related declines in our traditional business lines. For the remainder of the year, we expect that current trends will continue, namely that print book sales will continue to be challenged by COVID lockdowns and virtual learning. Note that print books represent a smaller portion of Wiley's overall business. Digital content and courseware will continue to grow strongly, helping to mitigate any potential decline this fall in higher ed enrollment.
Recovery in test prep will be dependent upon the reopening of testing sites and the resumption of certification exams. In corporate learning, we're seeing an acceleration of our virtual and hybrid corporate training products. We anticipate a strong post-pandemic recovery based upon what we are seeing in platform usage and new partner signings. Throughout APL, we're moving quickly to take advantage of the abrupt shift to digital learning by investing in our platforms and our go-to-market strategies.
This includes our value-driven business models that make content affordable. An example is our Inclusive Access program, which continues to grow very strongly. We are also responding to the moment by publishing timely titles on topics such as running businesses virtually and creating diverse, inclusive and equitable cultures. Finally, we're driving rapid and significant improvement in our cost structure to improve efficiency and our margin profile.
Our education services segment is positioned very well for this moment as universities, students and professionals are pivoting hard to both digital learning and online degrees. It will take time to fully realize the potential of this shift, but interest in our services, which help universities to succeed with online education, is running very high. For the quarter, revenue was up 29%, or 4% organically, and our EBITDA margin was 13%, which is up 9% for fiscal '20. Revenue growth was driven by $12 million of inorganic contribution from M3, as well as 9% growth in student enrollment.
Our mature and new programs are performing well, although organic growth was offset by small partner terminations as part of our continuous portfolio optimization. Our full-service partner count now stands at 67. We added two new full-service university partners in the quarter, the University of New Haven in Connecticut and Carlow University in Pennsylvania, and we signed additional universities for unbundled service agreements. Online program enrollment was very healthy this summer and remains so as we enter the fall semester.
At M3, we found the corporate demand for trained IT talent to be more stable in the pandemic than we had expected. Our existing customer base is solid, and we've begun placing new talent at several recently signed customers. Notably, we're gaining momentum in India where we are currently staffing a major new technology center for one of our global financial services clients. University services are facing significant pressures this year.
Universities are facing significant pressures this year as they simultaneously shift to hybrid and virtual learning while also dealing with financial shortfalls brought on by COVID-related enrollment declines. Although intermediate and long-term trends are very good, there is some near-term uncertainty to manage through with our clients. As with digital courseware, online education is now past the inflection point and is broadly adopted and accepted as a mainstream way to get a degree or certification. This was true before COVID, but the disruption of the past six months has driven home the value of high-quality, fairly priced education that can fit the life and career needs of the broad public.
This moment is reflected in enrollment trends and good pipeline of potential university partnerships, both in the U.S. and abroad and with our key partners, most of whom are evaluating online expansion opportunities. M3's IT talent placement volume is anticipated to be steady for the balance of the year as our corporate partners continue to maintain and grow their tech talent capacity. Major operational focus within education service is the continued improvement of the student journey from lead to enrollment.
These efforts continue to bear fruit in higher conversion rates and lower student acquisition costs. The business is well on track to realize its fiscal '22 goal of the 15% EBITDA margin. I'll now pass the call over to John to take you through our financial profile and optimization initiatives.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Brian. Despite a very challenging environment, we are generally pleased with our revenue and earnings performance for this quarter. That said, our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were unfavorable to prior year by $27 million and $20 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of changes in working capital. As a reminder, our cash flow is normally the use of cash in the first half of our fiscal year due to timing of collection for general subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
Capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, declined $6 million to $24 million for the quarter. As discussed on the last earnings call, we expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, with investment focused on new product and service capabilities, as well as process redesign and workflow automation. With respect to investment in acquisitions, we will remain opportunistic and continue our pursuit of attractive opportunities to add scale and provide enhanced tech-enabled products and services in both research and online education. In terms of our balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was up $117 million primarily due to acquisitions, but our interest expense was lower by $1.5 million as we realized the benefit of the lower interest rate environment.
Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.0 times, inclusive of all acquisitions. In terms of access to capital, we reported $101 million of cash on hand, and we ended the quarter with undrawn revolving credit of $650 million. Our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity afford us the flexibility to continue investing, acquiring and returning cash to shareholders. In June, the company modestly increased its quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.
Our current dividend yield is more than 4%. As a reminder, due to the economic downturn, we have refrained from repurchasing shares. We remain fully confident in our continued strategic momentum, cash generation and liquidity position, and we expect to resume share repurchases as the economic environment recovers. We are moving quickly on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the economic downturn and improve our agility and efficiency.
These programs are companywide and include optimizing our content development workflows, streamlining our customer support operations and achieving benchmark efficiency levels for corporate support functions, such as HR and finance. Meanwhile, we continue to maintain tight controls on discretionary spending across the company, and we have realized significant savings on travel, marketing events and professional fees. In addition, hiring and salary increases have been strictly limited to critical business needs and investment in our top performers. And in June, the executive leadership team and the board unanimously agreed to take six-month pay cuts ranging from 15% to 30%.
And as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a $15 million restructuring charge for actions that will generate annual run rate savings of approximately $30 million. Additional cost savings actions are anticipated in the current fiscal year. As an example, we are taking actions to rationalize our real estate portfolio given our successful transition to a virtual work environment. We will update you on our progress as the anticipated savings -- and the anticipated savings we will make throughout the year.
In summary, we are very well positioned to navigate the COVID-related challenges ahead while investing in key optimization and growth initiatives. As a reminder, given our limited visibility in the current economic environment, we have suspended our practice of providing annual guidance. We expect to return to providing guidance when the economic environment becomes more stable and our visibility improves. I'll now pass the call back to Brian.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. So, to recap the main messages for today, our business remains strong through the pandemic with good momentum continuing in both research and education services. We're experiencing COVID-related disruptions to print books and in-person training. Of course, this represents a smaller part of Wiley today, with nearly 80% of our revenue coming from digital products and tech-enabled services.
Core trends remain favorable in Wiley's key strategic areas of focus, such as peer-reviewed research, online education, digital content and courseware. We're taking full advantage of this unusual moment to drive improvement in the cost structure and core functioning of Wiley, focusing on high potential areas, such as our content development workflows, our management of the customer life cycle and the tuning of our real estate footprint for an increasingly virtual workforce. Overall, we're confident in the enduring importance of our Research and Education content, platforms and services. But more importantly, we're optimistic that this challenging moment -- at this challenging moment because we're seeing compelling evidence in our KPIs that our markets are strong and that our strategies are working.
To be specific, we're experiencing strong growth in demand to publish in our journals and consumer research, strong growth in Research platform signings, recurring revenue and content consumption with 98% client retention, strong growth in our digital courseware portfolio, strong growth in enrollment at our online degree programs and increased interest of universities in accelerating the transition to online education. So despite some near-term headwinds, the data tells me that we're tightly aligned with the current and long-term needs of our customers, the researchers, students, professors, administrators and corporate leaders that we serve worldwide. Once again, I want to thank our wonderful Wiley colleagues around the world for their grit, their positive spirit and their remarkable accomplishments this quarter. With that, I'll open the floor to your comments and questions.

Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with research. Obviously, a really solid growth in a difficult environment.
How much of the jump in article output and content consumption would you contribute to COVID-related research? And as a follow-up, how much of the jump in research revenue and EBITDA reflects things like reprints and back files, open access? Just trying to get a sense for that relative to maybe the kind of legacy Research business, if you will.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start, and John can chip in. So, we're seeing -- definitely seeing good momentum in Research publishing. The COVID crisis has definitely increased the interest in -- or the output of researchers, and we see no signs of that declining.
With respect to specific COVID-related research, we certainly are publishing more COVID-related papers, as you would expect. But as a percentage of our total,  It's a very small percentage.  It's really a much broader --  It's a much broader increase in demand that we're seeing at this point in time that's coming across the portfolio. And to answer your second question, a large portion of that is coming in open access.
So, we're seeing really good growth rates in our open access pay-to-publish models, which, as you know, is a price times quantity model. So, when that happens, that translates directly into our revenue base. So we're definitely feeling consistent and increasing demand. And the practices that we've taken in the marketplace, which have been very market friendly, we believe, are leading researchers to choose Wiley and choose our journal.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Indeed. And on OA specifically, is it more article output from the same customers? More interest from new parties? How would you sort of weigh those two?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you know, in Open Access, the researchers themselves are deciding where to submit their articles. And as they do, they're choosing the titles, meaning the journal titles, and the publishers that they want to work with. So, increasingly,  It's almost a B2C model in that case. And so, things like the reputation, the quality of the customer experience, the researcher experience as they go through the publishing process, the speed with which the article gets out and the quality with which it gets promoted are what drives that.
So, we believe that we're seeing researchers choose us, quite simply stated. If that answers your question, Dan. If I didn't answer it specifically, please follow up.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
No, that helps. Absolutely. Maybe one or two quick follow-ups. The -- given the growth in OA, if we were to break down Research between kind of annual contracted revenue versus more variable or consumption-based, what would that look like at this stage percentage-wise?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, currently, as you look at our -- go ahead, John. Yes.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
I'll answer this in a way that is also responsive, Dan, to your question about what was the composition of revenue in the quarter. Roughly speaking, about 80% of our revenue comes from the combination of subscriptions and open access. And within that, call it, 70% of our research publishing business is subscription and about 10% of it is OA. The remaining 20% of our business, Dan, is, frankly, largely products and services that are derivatives of articles that are published under subscription, such as reprints that you mentioned and such as corporate advertising.
So, that's roughly the split of revenue that we have today. And of course, the subscription base is largely contracted, right? So that's well in play, but we're coming up on a renewal season. You asked whether -- you asked about are there significant backhaul revenues or such in the quarter, and the answer to that is no. This was a pretty normal quarter for us in terms of the composition of products and services that drove our revenue.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
That's helpful because that can be really high margin. One more, and I'll jump out. But you alluded, Brian, to obviously the extraordinary pressures that universities will be facing. Given where the stock is and has been trading, I think there's a lot more fear out there than -- well, may or may not warranted, we'll see.
But I know you don't want to get into the guidance, but when you think about Research, is there a range -- I guess, one, how are those initial dialogues going for calendar '21? And two, is there a range of revenue growth that you might be able to -- at an extreme high, extreme low bracket to sort of rein in some of the fears out there? Maybe  It's too early, but I thought I'd give you the opportunity.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah, look, I mean,  It's a completely fair question, and  It's what we want to know as well. We're talking to our customers very, very closely, and we're trying to get a sense of it. But  It's really early in the renewal season, and so it really is too early to tell.
We do expect some price pressure. But we expect that that price pressure should be offset by this strong growth that you're seeing in OA and in platforms and other areas. So, the simple answer is  It's too early to tell but that we believe that the price pressure we face will be modest and that it will be largely offset, if not more than offset, by our open access growth.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
OK. Helpful. I'll follow up with -- jump back in queue with any follow-up.

Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, Brian, historically, when GDP has fallen and unemployment has risen, enrollment trends have accelerated. And listening to your preamble, it doesn't sound like that's what you're seeing or anticipating for the fall semester, but just want to get more detail around that.
And then, on a related note, the 4% organic growth for Ed Services that you reported in the quarter, is that indicative of what we should anticipate for the balance of fiscal '21? And then, I have a follow-up.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Got it. So, from the perspective of the demand patterns in higher ed, this -- there's no question that there is a relationship between GDP, unemployment and college enrollment. That -- historically, that relationship has been one with a bit of a lag, a 12 to 18-month lag. And so, we do expect that to play out here, and we believe we're already seeing it in our leads, in our interest and in our enrollment.
But really, traditionally, that's played out over time. What's happening now in enrollment is different than that, though. What's happening now is literally a practical preclusion on universities from running schools as they normally had and a depression or a downward pressure on enrollment that's come from health fears related to being in large groups of people, as everybody knows. So, what we're seeing -- the enrollment pressure we're seeing is not some sort of an inverse relationship to the tradition.
In fact,  It's a novel pressure. And that novel pressure was expected in the fall to be in the neighborhood of 10 or 15%. We think it could be on the lower end of that. But from Wiley's perspective, and this is really important, from Wiley's perspective, our -- and that has -- that, by the way, will affect our principal sales.
But from Wiley's perspective, our strategic growth areas are digital courseware and online education, and those run counter to the trends that we're seeing in the market because if you can't go to school in person, you go online. Or if you're supposed to -- if you're usually in a classroom, but now you're going to be studying from home in a virtual environment, you have no choice but to get the digital materials. You can't share. You can't -- a book is not going to help because you need to be in the courseware.
So, that is contributing to an upswell in the parts of that business that we are strategically focused on in the future. So both in the services business, where we're focused on online enrollment, and in the courseware business or the content business, where we're focused on digital content and courseware, we actually believe that this is a material change that will have a long-term benefit for the business. Then answering second part of your question, we are seeing -- obviously, results are backward-looking. And in the spring, we definitely saw some shock to the system from COVID that affected enrollments.
It just -- this is not surprising. But over this summer, we started to see elevated levels of interest in our -- in lead generation and in conversion, leading to pretty good enrollment trend. So, our enrollment actually was up around 9% recently, and then we should see some of that continue. But again, we're just getting into the semester.
We'll just see exactly how this start goes. And so, we're not at all pessimistic. Quite the contrary, we're optimistic about where that business is going and the enrollment trends due to the things that I've been talking about, both the short-term shift to online translating into a greater acceptance of online learning and online education where it is really is the norm now in many cases for a large portion of people getting postsecondary educations, and then followed by what we expect to be a significant, economically driven increase in interest in education due to the inverse relationship that you identified before between the economy and enrollment in schools.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Got it. OK. Very helpful. And then, I know you spent a lot of time talking about open access, and it, obviously, had a very good quarter.
Just any updated thoughts around the sustainability of that growth? And then, separately, John, can you address the timing-related working capital issues that impacted your cash flow during the quarter?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll pick up the OA question first. We're -- long before COVID, we were seeing significantly greater volumes of submissions and consequent volumes of our output. That has continued and increase through COVID-19.
We see no reason to believe that  It's not going to continue. There might be a slight elevation now that's related to researchers being at home and finishing up papers. You think that would've been done already, and yet the elevated levels continue, and in fact, they're increasing. So, we're very bullish on those volumes levels continuing at a high level on a go-forward basis.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
And then, Drew, on your question with respect to cash flow and, in particular, the impact of working capital that I referenced in my comments, which were the biggest drivers. I mean, by the way, we had very strong performance in the quarter from a real earnings growth perspective, but then working capital played against us. And in particular, I would note that our cash collections associated with journals were pretty strong and in line with our expectations, so we're feeling good about collections there. We do have some customers that have requested extended terms, but  It's not a material impact to our results, and we feel like that's flowing well.
The most significant impact on the timing of working capital has to do with payables. In the March -- late March and April time frame, like others, we went into a bit of cash conservation mode given potential risks around liquidity in the market at that point in time. And so, we put some pressure on payables at that time. And then, as things began to ease up in our first quarter, we also eased up on payables.
So, the ground that we gave up on cash flow in the quarter is particularly concentrated around payables, and  It's just sort of the normal flow back to a balance after conserving cash at the end of the fourth quarter.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
OK. All right guys appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Sami Kassab with Exane.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my questions, I have three of them, please. The first one is on a topic that I think you've just touched on, but I would kindly like you to perhaps elaborate a little bit more.
On open access, what's the risk that the elevated levels of submissions that we've seen actually reflect the fact that scientists have been locked down at home and away from their labs and had a lot of time to write papers but had no ability to make progress on their scientific research and that those three, four months will actually, six months, 12 months down the road, will lead to a slowdown in open access growth as science did not really happen through the lockdowns? Secondly, on China, we've seen the Chinese government communicate new research appraisal policies, pushing Chinese scientists to publish more into Chinese local language journals, [Inaudible] moving away from splicing. Do you think the China policy and regulatory changes may have an impact, or is that too small to matter? Is that not something that is big on your radar screen? Then lastly, can you elaborate a little bit on how you see the regulatory environment in OPM? We've had the likes of Bob Sherman and Senator Warren look at OPM. Do you think the regulatory environment could be at risk of changing? Or do you think  It's a solid regime that you have today and you have no major concerns on the regulatory front for OPM?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you very much for asking three questions, each of which is a dissertation. So, I'll take them one at a time. They're very good questions, excellent questions that I'd be asking if I were you. So the first one, on the risk of the elevated level of OA sort of bringing back to some lower level later, we are now six or more months into this pandemic; seven or eight, depending on where you're looking in the world.
We continue to see elevated levels. We continue to see researchers putting out papers. Researchers are going back into the labs, absolutely. And so, we're -- we expect it to continue at some level.
Could it come back a little bit? Of course, it could. We're at a very high level right now. But I will remind you that trends in research are very, very positive in terms of overall increasing volume of output in the marketplace. So, in other words, we see mid to high-single-digit increases in the volume of papers every year.
And that long preceded the environment. We consider that will continue in the future. The second thing is that the research continues to be something that is funded at a very high level. In countries around the world, we see no we see no signs of that declining.
So, yeah, I mean, there's no question that there could be a little bit of an artificial increase, but those artificial -- those increases have continued for quite some time now. The final thing I'd say on that is we believe that our publishing program and our approach to publishing is extremely researcher and market friendly, and we think we're getting more than our fair share of submissions. I'll also remind you that of all the submissions we get, we publish a very small portion of them, and so there's always increasing potential there. So, no, I don't see a snapback or a rebound that goes the wrong way on us in the future.
Now, the question of China, another really good question. China is a super important market in the future of research. China is a very important producer and consumer of research. China represents around 5% of our research publishing business now.
So, from a business perspective,  It's not going to swing us one way or the other in any given quarter, but it is very important in the long run, and we are -- and the increasing discussion in China about their endemic -- or indigenous publishing is certainly an important move and important trend. But we have very, very close relationships in China. We have a very good connection to the government agencies and so forth there, and we continue to stay very close to them. Chinese researchers want their journals to be in the best journals in the world so that they can get the recognition and the -- for their work that they desire, and we believe our publishing portfolio leads us there.
But also, we are increasingly partnering in China to make sure that we are seen as the publisher of choice. So, while there is some -- there's always some concern when there are discussions going on in places like China about changes in policy, we believe that, ultimately, we're very well positioned to capitalize on what is still continuing significant growth in both Chinese publishing and Chinese consumption. On the --
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Sorry, may I squeeze in a follow-up before we move to OPM? In subscription unbundling and sub has seen some strong takeup, a third of R1 universities on unsub within less than a year. Do you see a trend or risk toward more unbundling of the big deals, especially in the U.S. as universities face budgetary pressure?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So, if the question is about unbundling and whether we are seeing more or we'll be seeing more, as universities face pressure, they certainly are looking for ways to save cost. I've said we can't really comment on what we expect that pricing pressure to be. But as we look into the market, we don't see a lot of evidence.
We see some one-off cases, but we don't see a lot of evidence of universities and university librarians saying we don't need that content, our researchers don't need it, we're not using it. So, to the extent that we have a high -- which we do, a very high-quality portfolio of journals that is essential to the success of research, we will continue to be purchased by those universities. I'll remind you that academics make their careers based upon research, and universities climb the rankings or to descend in the rankings based upon their positioning in the research ecosystem and both the volume and the quality of their output. So, research and research content is absolutely central to the success of our important clients.
So, while we may see some edge cases because, to be sure, there's pressure in the marketplace, we don't see any sort of any evidence of a large-scale trend toward unbundling. OK. And let me move toward OPM. So, the conversation about OPM has gone on for a long time, and the conversation about the revenue share model has gone on for a long period of time.
We start from the position that we have excellent relationships, long-term relationships with our universities, and we help those universities fundamentally to succeed. We help them to succeed by providing extremely high-quality programs, by attracting students and by matriculating those students at extremely high completion rates, higher completion rates than typically they see in their on-ground programs. So, insofar as we are doing that, we are helping those universities to succeed. There has long been a conversation about the revenue share model.
Our clients seem to be fine with it. Now, to be sure, there will be some movement in the marketplace there, and therefore, Wiley has adopted again, as we always do, very market friendly practices of working with universities on terms that they believe are fair. And we have our bundled revenue share model businesses, we have our fee-for-service businesses and so forth. So, we believe wherever the market goes, we're going to be fine.
Having said that, we participate very closely in the discussions that go on in Washington and elsewhere on the future of education, generally speaking, and on the future of of higher ed and its relationship with service providers. So, we've responded to the various inquiries. They have been ongoing. We expect them to continue to be ongoing.
But we're very close to it, and we are not -- our confidence in the future is based upon the fact that we're in a consensual relationship, if you call it, with our partners, who are getting a tremendous amount out of it. If we, together, or if they decide they want to go in a different direction, we're very happy to go in a different direction with them, and we always have been. So we don't view it as a major threat.  It's something to be talked about,  It's something to be studied,  It's something to be adapted to.
But we are confident in our position and, more importantly, the position and the quality of the services and the value of the services that we provide to the marketplace.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
This is fantastic and all very convincing. You said in your opening remarks that you had higher completion rates. Did you mean that your OPM program has higher completion rate than equivalent on-campus programs have?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Typically speaking, our programs -- I will say, our programs have very high completion rates for the students that start and those that complete the program. I'll remind you that, historically, when the industry has come under pressure, it has been for universities and education providers that have had extremely low completion rates, such that students started but they never finished and, therefore, never got value for the education that they paid for or that somebody else, such as the government or the taxpayer, paid for. That is absolutely not the case in our programs. The completion rates are extremely high, and our clients are happy with them.
And, clearly, students are happy with them because they're staying through to completion and achieving career outcomes that perpetuate the demand for the product.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen. Prior to COVID, rearing its ugly head, margins were eroding. Was that from your conversion from hard copy to digital, or did it relate to state cutbacks in education?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
John, do you want to pick that up?
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, just generally, looking back over fiscal year '20, we did see some erosion of our margin. I would say that the most significant drivers behind that erosion of margin were two. One was the rapid -- continued rapid decline of print, which has reasonably good margins.
But print, as we know, is in decline, and that rate of decline got a bit faster in the past fiscal year and had an impact on our bottom line. We're taking actions, as we discussed in today's review, to improve the profitability of that business by focusing and by, in particular, focusing our future on digital courseware and digital content. The second factor that contributed overall to the shift in the blended margin of the business, there's an increased component of our revenue coming from OPM business that we just talked about. And we recognize that in its current state, the market itself in its current state that operating margins are low.
But we've been emphasizing that we are balancing between top line growth, which is very important to us, and improving profitability there. And we said that we would drive that business to 15% EBITDA margin by next year, and we're well on the march to get there. But those are the two factors that have been putting pressure on our margin, and both of them are being addressed.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
If going forward, there are continued high levels of unemployment, is that a tailwind in that there's a tendency for enrollments in school to go up in that kind of macroeconomic environment?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I'll pick that back up, John. As I was indicating earlier, there is a long term -- and in fact, I think it was either Dan or Drew that pointed it out, there is a long-term established pattern of when the economy goes down and unemployment goes up, that people go back to school. That relationship is typically a lagged relationship, meaning it happens not instantly, it happens 12 to 18 months later, and we do expect to see that.
But we have other tailwinds that are hitting us right now, which is simply that people can't go to school in person. They're physically precluded from going to school fully in person. And so, therefore, we have elevated levels of interest from potential students in taking education in an online world. It also is providing a tailwind, as I indicated earlier, to our digital courseware businesses, which, as I indicated in my remarks, are seeing record increases in usage and adoption because again, if you're not in a physical setting, you need a learning management system based product, something that -- where your teacher can make assignments, where you can do homework, where you can get the content predictably, the content that the teacher needs, not have to Google for your curriculum.
And physical books just aren't as good in those environments. They don't do all those things. And so, there's a significant tailwind that hits you in that sense. And, again, as I indicated, the -- we believe that these are accelerations of long-term trends so that it won't be a short-term blip.
We believe that we're going to see continued elevation of those levels, which is completely -- all of these trends that I'm talking about are completely in sync and aligned with our strategy that we've been working on for the last few years. And  It's gratifying to see it start to come to fruition at a time when the world needs both education and research more than ever.

291,matt@logrocket.com,"In an unprecedented year that saw many teams shift to remote working, we asked tech and business leaders to pick their essential tools.
Throughout our Leaders Insights series on Siliconrepublic.com last year, we asked a host of tech and business leaders from Ireland and further afield to name the essential tools and resources that get them through the working week.
In a year that brought major disruption to most of our working lives, they turned to video conferencing, collaboration software and a whole lot of coffee.
Handy hardware
The move away from offices means many of us are now relying on tech devices for both work and keeping in touch. Seán Keating of Vilicom said his number-one tool is his smartphone. Its like the Swiss army knife of business tools. It keeps me on schedule, navigates to meetings, runs all our most important business apps, connects my laptop to our IT cloud, enables our Teams communications and more.
HPs Gary Tierney said that his phone and laptop are the must-have items for work, but since the arrival of Covid-19 he has been relying more on his laptop. Ive found that working from home has put an even greater emphasis on the criticality of my PC as a communication tool and a general workhorse.
Many people also had to figure out a new at-home work set-up last year. I recently invested in a 38-inch ultra-wide monitor and its been a game changer for me, Joe Lennon of Workvivo told us over the summer.
Video conferencing
2020 was the year we all became very familiar with Zoom (as well as Zoombombing and Zoom fatigue).
Amy Bunszel of Autodesk said she now spends most of her day on Zoom, and Patrick Horgan of Horizon8 said tools such as Zoom are proving incredibly helpful in the work-from-home dynamic.
But there are plenty of other alternatives out there. Microsoft Teams was highlighted as an essential daily tool by plenty of people, including SL Controls Keith Moran, CWSIs Ronan Murphy and Avanades Graham Healy.
Martin McKay of Texthelp said he couldnt be without the Google Meet and Chat tools at the moment, and Xilinxs Brendan Farley said Skype and Webex are other options being used for video calls.
Online collaboration tools are integral to not just our success but our basic functioning, added Ogie Sheehy of ViClarity. Whether it is Zoom or GoToMeeting, Google Chat or Microsoft Teams, these tools are enabling us to continue to work uninterrupted across a global footprint. 
Software saviours
While Microsoft Teams has seen a sharp rise in users in the past year, many companies have been relying on other products from the Microsoft 365 stack. Ronan Murphy of CWSI said these tools allow his company to do whatever we need to do from wherever we are.
SoftwareOnes Una Keeshan said she uses the focus plan in Microsoft MyAnalytics to set aside time for priority work, while Avanades Graham Healy said he uses Microsoft Dynamics for customer relationship management and Power BI for reporting, forecasting and analytics.
With teams dispersed, messaging and collaboration tools such as Slack also came to the fore. Its a convenient way to collaborate over projects and to organise ourselves according to different topics and business functions, said Oz Alashe of CybSafe.
Collaboration tools have always been important for developers. Joe Lennon of Workvivo said GitHub is fundamental for his engineering team to manage source code and code reviews, and they regularly use Tuple to do remote pair programming.
Jennifer Sethre of Intry said Intercom and LogRocket are important tools for her HR tech company, and Keith Moran of SL Controls turns to the Frankli platform for engaging with his team.
Lettertecs Frank Kelly uses Google Keep for jotting quick notes down as they occur, while ViClaritys Ogie Sheehy is a fan of the voice dictation app on his iPhone. It allows me to be immediately responsive to important emails that come through when I am out and about and away from my desk, he said.
A good old-fashioned to-do list
While there may be a fancy tech tool for everything, many leaders still rely on a simple to-do list to keep focused. Nessa McEniff of Learnovate said listing her priorities is a key part of the week and shes a bit of an obsessive list maker.
Netssos Brian ODoherty added that a having a clear list keeps him grounded. I set myself a weekly list and find that its a great way of keeping the faith in myself, my work and my ambitions, he said.
But Liz Cunningham of Google said she is still looking for the perfect tool that will manage all her to-do lists across personal and work life to help keep all the balls in the air.
PayPals Annette Hickey noted that her calendar helps keep her focused throughout the week, and Dells Jason Ward said an organised calendar is key to ensuring I am as productive as possible.
Keeping the mind clear
The sudden shift to remote working means that many have had to find new ways to focus, while still maintaining a good work-life balance and not overworking now that your kitchen may be your office.
To help with this, Nicole Sahin of Globalization Partners said she keeps Fridays free of Zoom meetings. Its like heaven to have that time to think and get things done.
Similarly, Codemas Donna Gartland said that, since the shift to working from home, she now blocks time in her calendar each week without meetings to focus and get deep work done. I use distraction blockers across all my devices, she added, such as Stay Focusd on my browser and Focus mode on Pixel.
Xilinxs Brendan Farley said he removed the work email app from his phone many years ago, which helps him switch off in the evenings. And Mark Cockerill of ServiceNow suggested having a great Spotify playlist on hand.
Getting away from the desk
For minding mental and physical health, many other leaders also suggested getting out and about. SL Controls Keith Moran enjoys a good game of squash in the evening, Arkphires Paul Nannetti tries to run on the beach a few times a week, and Fenergos Louise OConnell said that yoga or a walk in the fresh air can help to just clear the mind.
Una Keeshan of SoftwareOne has recently taken tennis back up as a hobby. The tennis is not only great exercise, she said, but also helps me clear my head from work or the stresses of the day.
And Autodesks Amy Bunszel said that, now she doesnt have a commute for the time being, its a bit easier to make time for exercise every morning and a nice dinner in the evening.
Food certainly plays a key part in the day for many. Horizon8s Patrick Horgan said the barbecue has proved an essential tool for bringing his family together in the current environment.
And one of the essential tools to get Dells Jason Ward through the week? Coffee, coffee and more coffee.",,
290,kj@mentedcosmetics.com,"With $4 billion in sales in 12 months and a rosy forecast ahead, lipstick manufacturers were smiling at the end of 2019, and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing face masks and an unstable economy. With no end to the crisis in sight, brands large and small have had to adjust manufacturing, advertising, and social media on the fly. The results, they say, are paying off — and may mark the beginning of profound changes for the cosmetics industry.
Beyond changes in everyday demand for lip color, some businesses have found themselves re-examining everything from their supply chain up. E.L.F. Beauty, a mass-market brand founded in 2004, reacted to the pandemic earlier than most, according to Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer, because it sources its products abroad. It made changes in early January — weeks before Western countries entered lockdown — when its operation in China was impacted. It has managed to adjust and keep customers supplied, but has noticed a shift in what people are buying. 
Lipstick has slid, most likely because people cared less about the colors of their lips when they're all having to wear masks and the economic fallout of lockdown, but sales of other items rose to pick up the slack.
""We saw a surge in the market around bronzer and brow, so we swiftly deployed assets and messaging to accelerate E.L.F. bronzers and brow products,"" Marchisotto says. ""As we continue navigating through COVID-19, we closely monitor consumer signals and learn that they don't just change monthly or weekly during this crisis. They can change daily or even hourly.""
These shifts are happening across the industry. A May report from McKinsey, the consultancy giant, found cosmetics sales had dropped 55% among prestige brands. ""When consumers do return to work, many will continue to wear masks, further slowing makeup's recovery,"" the report said. However, the report noted that sales of skin-, nail- and hair-care products in Europe had quadrupled, as more people pampered themselves at home — and a September report from market research firm NPD found that more women in the US were using facial skincare products than in 2019.
This constant adjustment has been particularly challenging for independent brands, which may not have the cash or infrastructure to absorb huge drops in sales or swings in their inventory. For Mented, a growing, Black-owned brand with a dedicated following for its highly-pigmented color cosmetics, the pandemic has proved challenging — but surprising, in a good way.
Cofounder Amanda E. Johnson says: ""We were planning on having a great 2020 and then March hit. It was slow in the beginning for everybody, because COVID shook the world and no one knew what was going on. So, we thought, 'oh, we're going to have a horrible year like everyone else.'""
The company adjusted its forecast down 40% and braced for disaster, but was shocked when April's sales figures came in. ""We were like, ""Oh my God, this is the biggest month in the history of the company. It must be an anomaly."" It wasn't. Sales are actually trending up and projections have been readjusted.
Amanda E. Johnson, cofounder and COO of Mented Cosmetics.
Mented Cosmetics
Johnson says the fact the business has always been online only helped — as did its focus on people of color. She also believes that lipstick, despite rising mask-wearing, is finding its place in the pandemic with two very different kinds of consumers. ""One, there's the professional that's working from home. So, if she is working from home, she's on Zoom and Team and Google Hangout calls all day long"" and secondly, ""the essential worker. So, we've asked, why are you still putting on lipstick every day? And what we've heard back is, because 'I need something to make me feel good right now.'""
Marchisotto agrees, predicting the business will keep promoting beauty as an important element of self-care in a difficult time. One nurse wrote to the company saying its primer had changed her life — this kind of direct feedback is important at a time when all historical models of trends are obsolete. ""It was another moment for us to understand the power of our products. We don't just sell beauty."" 
While the path forward is still unclear, Johnson is beginning to think that marketing products as an indulgence could prove successful. ""Women are definitely still buying makeup in droves,"" she says, but adds that the difference is ""they want brands to tell them that they're doing the right thing.""
It remains to be seen which platforms are best for telling buyers that. TikTok, Home Shopping Network, and Instagram have all shown good results for these brands. The message is clearly one consumers want to hear. ""Historically, color cosmetics has been a 'recession-proof product,'"" Johnson said. ""And I think what we're seeing is, in some ways, it is also pandemic proof.""",I saw that E.L.F. Beauty reacted to the pandemic earlier than most because you source your products abroad. A May report from McKinsey found cosmetics sales dropped 55% among prestige brands. Have you noticed this at E.L.F?,

Results at a Glance

</li></ul>
Streamlining and repositioning the business at the end of 2019 has paid dividends throughout 2020. Smokeless saw continued same store sales momentum in MST and newfound strength in loose leaf chewing tobacco. Smoking (Zig-Zag) saw its highest growth rate in recent history driven by product and channel growth initiatives behind rolling papers, the benefits of greater control of our MYO cigar wraps business after the Durfort transaction closed in the second quarter, and a burgeoning e-commerce presence. The NewGen segment navigated admirably through significant market disruption caused by the PMTA application deadline, said Larry Wexler, President and CEO. Overall, we are seeing ongoing benefits from re-shaping our business towards a more growth-oriented mindset and are able to raise our outlook once again for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Recent Events
As detailed in a separate press release, TPB today announced a $15 million strategic investment in leading global cannabinoid company dosist and an exclusive co-development and distribution agreement of a new national CBD brand, created in partnership with dosists thc-free business unit. Additionally, TPB has an option to invest another $15 million at pre-determined terms within the next 12 months. TPB has been issued a warrant to receive preferred shares of dosist that will automatically be exercised upon a change in federal laws in the United States to reschedule or deschedule cannabis and/or permit its general cultivation, distribution and possession. As part of this agreement, TPB will also have an option to fill a seat on the board of directors of dosist upon legalization.
On October 5, 2020, TPB announced the acquisition of a 20% stake in Wild Hempettes LLC (Wild Hempettes), a leading manufacturer of hemp cigarettes under the WildHemp and Hempettes brands, with options to increase its stake to a 100% ownership position based on certain milestones. As part of the transaction, TPB will be the exclusive distributor of Hempettes to U.S. bricks and mortar retailers.
On October 1, 2020, TPB sold the assets of its remaining owned retail stores in Oklahoma. As consideration for the transaction, TPB will receive a royalty from the acquiror, while also receiving rights to market and test products in the stores on a quarterly basis. Year-to-date sales and gross profit for those stores was $2.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively. This transaction continues our efforts to streamline the NewGen segment, as part of our announcement in the fourth quarter 2019 for the exploration of strategic alternatives for the third-party vaping distribution business.
On September 8, 2020, TPB announced it had submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Premarket Tobacco Applications (PMTAs) covering 250 products, an important and necessary step for TPB to offer adult consumers an extensive portfolio of products that serve as alternatives to combustible cigarettes and satisfy a wide variety of consumer preferences. The PMTAs covered a broad assortment of products in the vapor category including multiple proprietary e-liquid offerings in varying nicotine strengths, technologies and sizes; proprietary replacement parts and components of open system tank devices through partnerships with two leading manufacturers for exclusive distribution of products in the United States; and a closed system e-cigarette. The PMTAs provided clarity to customers and retail partners of TPBs continued support behind products across multiple leading brands including Solace, VaporFi®, South Beach Smoke, HorizonTech®, FreeMaX® and other developing brands and partnerships.
Smokeless Products Segment (29% of total net sales in the quarter)
For the third quarter, Smokeless products net sales increased 13.7% to $29.8 million on double-digit growth of MST and loose leaf chewing tobacco. MST represented 59% of Smokeless revenues in the quarter, up from 58% a year earlier. In the quarter, total Smokeless segment volume increased 10.3% and price/mix advanced 3.4%.
MST continued to gain market momentum driven by strong same store sales growth despite a tough comparable. The outlook continues to be bright for this product line with increasing consumer acceptance and further distribution gains, said Graham Purdy, Chief Operating Officer. Our loose leaf chewing tobacco business saw accelerated growth during the quarter as targeted selling initiatives that began earlier in the year led to meaningful year-over-year market share growth according to MSAi.
For the quarter, Smokeless segment gross profit increased 18.1% to $16.0 million. Segment gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 53.9% primarily as a result of strong incremental margin contribution of MST.
Smoking Products Segment (34% of total net sales in the quarter)
For the third quarter, net sales of Smoking products increased 19.0% to $36.0 million. Growth was driven by double-digit advances in US rolling papers and MYO cigar wraps. This more than offset a $2.0 million decline in our Canadian papers business which compared against an inventory load-in during last years third quarter. Non-focus cigars and MYO pipe declined $0.3 million. In the quarter, total Smoking segment volume increased 18.0% while price/mix increased 1.0%.
This segment of the business is benefitting from new product introductions and channel-specific sales efforts that are expanding market share and better aligning our growth to cannabis consumption trends. While increased consumption related to COVID-19 benefitted our US rolling papers business, we were encouraged to see our volumes grow significantly above the industry growth rate during the quarter. Our emerging e-commerce business demonstrated strong progress with sales roughly doubling from the previous quarter, said Purdy. In addition, post-the Durfort transaction, we now have a stronger and more direct working relationship with our MYO cigar wrap manufacturer which is enabling us to ramp production better to align with consumer demand.
For the quarter, Smoking products gross profit increased 27.9% to $21.3 million. Segment gross margin expanded 410 basis points to 59.1% as a result of increased US rolling paper sales and increased margin in MYO cigar sales as a result of the Durfort transaction.
NewGen (New Generation) Products Segment (37% of total net sales in the quarter)
For the third quarter, NewGen segment net sales decreased 4.8% to $38.4 million. Flat performance in our vape distribution business and double-digit growth from Solace and other Nu-X products was offset by a decline in RipTide which compared against a trade load-in during its launch in the prior year period.
Our NewGen business performed in-line with our expectations as the business managed through a challenging competitive environment created by the PMTA deadline with competitors liquidating inventories in anticipation of exiting the market. The recent sale of the remaining Vapor Shark stores continues the streamlining of the segment, said Purdy. While we still expect short-term disruption related to the PMTA process to impact our fourth quarter, the extensive portfolio of products submitted through the PMTA process has us increasingly optimistic about our outlook going forward as the market consolidates.
For the quarter, NewGen gross profit decreased 12.8% to $11.0 million. Segment gross margin decreased 260 basis points to 28.6% primarily due to temporary pricing pressure as competitors liquidated inventories and inventory reserves. Third quarter 2020 included $2.3 million of tariff expense compared to $2.6 million a year-ago.
Other Events and Performance Measures in the Third Quarter
Third quarter consolidated selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $32.3 million compared to $29.8 million in 2019 with the increase primarily due to non-recurring PMTA-related expenses incurred during the quarter as detailed below.
The third quarter had notable non-recurring impacts:
<ul><li>
$5.3 million of FDA PMTA-related expenses as compared to $0.2 million in the year-ago period; and
</li><li>
$0.6 million of transaction expenses principally related to M&amp;A activity as compared to $0.5 million in the year-ago period.
</li></ul>
The third quarter also included a $1.2 million non-cash charge within net periodic costs related to the termination of our defined benefit pension plan in 2019. We received net $1.7 million of cash related to the termination of the plan.
Total gross debt as of September 30, 2020, was $328.0 million. The corresponding net debt (total gross debt less cash) at September 30, 2020 was $260.6 million. The company ended the quarter with total liquidity of $113.8 million comprising $67.4 million of cash and $46.4 million of revolving credit facility capacity.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 82,097 shares at an average price of $28.95.
2020 Outlook Update
Taking into account the strength we have seen thus far this year and expected near-term volatility within our NewGen segment, we revise our guidance provided on July 28, 2020 as follows:
Absent any further acquisitions, the company projects 2020 net sales to be $395 to $401 million (up from previous guidance of $370 to $382 million). We project 2020 Adjusted EBITDA of $87 million to $90 million (up from previous guidance of $78 to $83 million).
Stock compensation and non-cash incentive expense in 2020 is projected to be $2.8 million.
The company spent a total of $16.6 million on the PMTA process, in-line with previous guidance of $16 to $18 million. This is inclusive of $2.2 million spent in 2019 and $14.4 million in the first three quarters of 2020.
Cash interest expense is projected to be $12 million and GAAP interest expense includes $7 million of debt discount amortization equal to the fair value of the equity components over the expected life of the 2024 convertible notes.
The company expects the 2020 effective income tax rate to be 23% to 24%.
Capital expenditures for 2020 are anticipated to be approximately $6 million (up from previous guidance of $4 to $6 million) as we have accelerated certain capital expenditure projects due to temporary tax code incentives.

Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of words such as ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""plan"" and ""will"" or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. As a result, actual events may differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by TPB in this press release speaks only as of the date hereof.

TPB has no obligation, and does not intend, to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof, except as required by federal securities laws. Factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to:
<ul><li>
declining sales of tobacco products, and expected continuing decline of sales, in the tobacco industry overall;
</li><li>
our dependence on a small number of third-party suppliers and producers;
</li><li>
the possibility that we will be unable to identify or contract with new suppliers or producers in the event of a supply or product disruption;
</li><li>
the possibility that our licenses to use certain brands or trademarks will be terminated, challenged or restricted;
</li><li>
failure to maintain consumer brand recognition and loyalty of our customers;
</li><li>
our reliance on relationships with several large retailers and national chains for distribution of our products;
</li><li>
uncertainty and continued evolution of markets containing our NewGen products;
</li><li>
intense competition and our ability to compete effectively;
</li><li>
competition from illicit sources;
</li><li>
regulation of our products by the FDA, which has broad regulatory powers;
</li><li>
our products are subject to developing and unpredictable regulation, for example, current court action moving forward certain substantial Pre Market Tobacco Application obligations;
</li><li>
uncertainty related to the regulation and taxation of our NewGen products;
</li><li>
possible significant increases in federal, state and local municipal tobacco- and vapor-related taxes;
</li><li>
sensitivity of end-customers to increased sales taxes and economic conditions;
</li><li>
substantial and increasing U.S. regulation;
</li><li>
possible increasing international control and regulation;
</li><li>
failure to comply with certain regulations;
</li><li>
imposition of significant tariffs on imports into the U.S.;
</li><li>
the scientific communitys lack of information regarding the long-term health effects of certain substances contained in some of our products;
</li><li>
some of our products contain nicotine which is considered to be a highly addictive substance;
</li><li>
contamination of our tobacco supply or products;
</li><li>
requirement to maintain compliance with master settlement agreement escrow account;
</li><li>
our amount of indebtedness;
</li><li>
the terms of our credit facilities, which may restrict our current and future operations;
</li><li>
significant product liability litigation;
</li><li>
reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors, potentially decreasing our stock price;
</li><li>
failure to maintain our status as an emerging growth company before the five-year maximum time period a company may retain such status;
</li><li>
our principal stockholders will be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders and may take certain actions to prevent takeovers;
</li><li>
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law and certain regulations, could discourage or prohibit acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock;
</li><li>
our certificate of incorporation limits the ownership of our common stock by individuals and entities that are Restricted Investors. These restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in Restricted Investors being required to sell or redeem their shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution rights;
</li><li>
our business may be damaged by events outside of our suppliers control, such as the impact of epidemics (e.g., coronavirus), political upheavals, or natural disasters;
</li><li>
our reliance on information technology;
</li><li>
security and privacy breaches;
</li><li>
infringement on our intellectual property;
</li><li>
third-party claims that we infringe on their intellectual property;
</li><li>
failure to manage our growth;
</li><li>
failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions or otherwise be unable to benefit from pursuing acquisitions;
</li><li>
fluctuations in our results;
</li><li>
exchange rate fluctuations;
</li><li>
adverse U.S. and global economic conditions;
</li><li>
departure of key management personnel or our inability to attract and retain talent;
</li><li>
future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us; and
</li><li>
we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, we use non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, and Adjusted Operating Income. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, and Adjusted Operating Income are used by management to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes and are presented to our board of directors. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS and Adjusted Operating Income are appropriate measures of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance.
We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, other non-cash items and other items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define Adjusted diluted EPS as diluted earnings per share excluding items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define Adjusted Operating Income as operating income excluding depreciation, amortization, LIFO, other non-cash items and other items that we do not consider ordinary course in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance.
Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted diluted EPS and Adjusted Operating Income exclude significant expenses that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements and is subject to inherent limitations. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate this non-U.S. GAAP measure differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided, in the supplemental information attached, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the next directly comparable GAAP measures.

274,amrit@axiomcloud.ai,"Clean energy entrepreneurs sometimes bemoan Silicon Valley's preference for funding software startups instead of the tough tech needed to tackle problems like climate change and crumbling infrastructure. But sometimes software really does the trick.
Amrit Robbins found that out the hard way. The Stanford alum founded and led Axiom Exergy, an East Bay startup that raised at least $12.5 million to equip grocery stores with thermal batteries. Those devices use electricity to pre-cool so they can take over refrigeration duties during hours when electricity gets more expensive, saving money for the store.
If a power outage hits, thermal storage can keep food cool for several hours, preventing food spoilage. It was a specific instance of a central theme in the clean energy industry: helping a paying customer while making the broader grid system cleaner and more efficient.
That company shut down last year after five years, hit by the upheavals of 2020 and the realization that the hardware business wasn't going to scale. But Robbins managed to rally his employees, buy back the intellectual property, and relaunch as Axiom Cloud.
The new startup delivers most of the benefits of the predecessor, but with a pure software product that operates existing refrigeration systems more efficiently.
""We’re able to deliver ROI that’s spectacularly better,"" Robbins told Greentech Media this week. 
On Tuesday, Axiom Cloud revealed a $1.1 million seed round led by Ulu Ventures and joined by Powerhouse Ventures, Lorimer Ventures and Correlation Ventures. The software is already live in dozens of grocery stores, including outlets of Whole Foods and three other major grocery chains in the U.S. and Canada, Robbins said.
The newly raised funds will go to delivering the service to hundreds of stores by the end of the year, he added.
Hard times for hardware
Axiom Exergy needed a bridge round of funding in early 2020. By March, the extent of the COVID-19 crisis was becoming apparent. Plummeting oil prices forced spending cutbacks for energy companies like Shell, which had been a major investor. 
On top of those new challenges, Axiom's hardware business was proving more difficult to scale than it sounded on paper.
""We just weren’t moving as quickly as we had hoped was going to be possible,"" Robbins said.
Axiom Exergy tried to pivot to software late in the game, but it was structurally committed to the hardware play. Major backers like Shell and Evergy Ventures based their commitments on the risk profiles and returns of a hardware company, not a software company. The startup had committed to R&amp;D investments, equipment purchases and even insurance products needed for adapting thermal storage tanks to interface with commercial refrigeration machinery. Those once-necessary investments weighed down the enterprise, complicating a switch to software as the primary business.
""We tried everything we possibly could to keep it alive, but there just wasn’t a clear path forward,"" Robbins said.
Robbins shut the company down in June. But he and the team thought there was still potential in the software they had developed to accompany the thermal batteries. Instead of using a tank of saline solution to store energy, a grocery store can use software to pre-cool its freezers to dodge utility demand charges. Axiom Exergy had also been working on a preventive maintenance product using artificial intelligence to flag refrigeration performance that presages costly equipment breakdown.
The Axiom alums decided to rally around those software capabilities with a new company, dubbed Axiom Cloud. They bought back their old intellectual property and customer relationships from Turntide, an electric motor company that acquired them after Axiom Exergy shut down. Turntide bought into the concept and invested in the new company, Robbins said.
New beginnings
The new strategy offers subscription-based apps that extract data from existing commercial refrigeration equipment, then use cloud computing and AI to put that information to use.  
The Virtual Battery product pre-cools systems to shed load during peak windows, avoiding expensive utility charges. Crucially, the service doesn't just provide interesting charts for an energy manager to look at — it operates the system more efficiently on its own.
""Our output is actually taking actions autonomously,"" Robbins said. ""Our customer isn’t interested in buying a to-do list.""
Another product, Virtual Technician, compares refrigeration performance against a digital model of the ideal, in order to identify maintenance needs before a failure occurs.
For installation, Axiom hires a local contractor to connect a small computer box to the customer's existing equipment. Axiom's device only interacts with refrigeration, Robbins noted, so it remains independent from the grocery store's other IT systems.
The upshot is, Axiom can give a customer bill savings without the cost or complexity of integrating bulky new machinery into refrigeration facilities. 
If the customer base continues to grow, Axiom's services will shift grocery store power consumption away from the peak hours that drive disproportionate grid costs and carbon emissions. The flexibility they provide is valuable in its own right, Powerhouse Ventures Managing Partner Emily Kirsch noted in a blog post Tuesday.
""With Virtual Battery, Axiom Cloud has the potential to bring hundreds of megawatts of load flexibility to the grid without requiring new energy storage hardware,"" she said.",I see that that Axiom Exergy is relaunching as Axiom Cloud. What does a smart rebrand like that do for your company's awareness with potential customers?,

Following on from a previous article, Purpose-Driven Blockchain, it has become increasingly obvious that there is a growing global movement of people, companies, and groups, seeking to collaborate with innovative blockchain projects that address universal technical challenges, increase adoption, and develop public goods.  Is there money to be made?  Yes.  However, the social impact of emerging technology is being prioritized by many. 
Charities Embrace Crypto To Achieve Their Missions
Speaking with James Harrington, founder and executive director of the Ugandan Water Project, he noted, its good to see how blockchain is creeping towards solutions beyond currency and finance. My connection to water development in Uganda has exposed me to the great need for blockchain asset management systems for land and equipment. Theft through the legal system is a common occurrence that robs vulnerable populations of the few assets they have fought for and prevents them from establishing needed leverage to catapult themselves out of poverty. Blockchain will play a key role in managing things like real estate titles in a way that is not vulnerable to bribes and other predatory practices. 
Like many charities feeling the pressure to stay on course with funding, Harrington looked for alternative methods for people to donate to his charity.  Cryptocurrency, while uncharted territory for the charity, proved to be light in the darkness.   Harrington added, once we researched the market and made sure everything was legal and above board, we found trusted partners, to help make it really simple to make cryptocurrency donations.  His charity now works with The Giving Block and mWater.  The intersection of old problems like contaminated water and new tools like blockchain and cloud-based data is making it possible for all of us to make a difference in the water crisis.
Same Mission, New Tech
Ethereum Classic Labs (ETC Labs), too, is on a mission to fulfill the promise of blockchain to improve peoples lives.  Looking beyond how charities leverage blockchain and cryptocurrency, Ethereum Classic Labs (ETC Labs) stands out for its socially impactful investments in projects and initiatives that further financial inclusion, women's participation in technology, and wildlife conservation. When asked why they are passionate about these particular investments, the ETC Labs team said they are on a mission to make Ethereum Classic and other chains work to benefit people's lives and work to deliver social and economic value. 
As blockchain is still seen as an emerging technology, there is more opportunity to make a greater impact in emerging markets and developing economies.  Their work shines a spotlight on emerging markets and how one can more quickly and more effectively deliver economic values. As part of these social impact efforts, they issue grants to propel research and development in scalability, storage, interoperability, and adoption in the greater blockchain economy.
ETC Labs is now supporting three global initiatives promising to improve the health and finances of citizens across the world, in addition to their $1 million commitment to UNICEFs Innovation Fund.  Such initiatives include Pngme, Prescrypto, and OS City.
Pngme has been working with banks and other financial institutions in West Africa to encourage the use of Ethereum Classic to put each person back in control of their own financial data and receive quicker loan approval to foster business growth.
Prescrypto uses the ETC blockchain to keep track of patients' prescription history and allow it to be safely sent to pharmacists. Demonstrating impressive growth and usability, Prescrypto has averaged 12,000 prescriptions per month.
OS City is a Latin America-based govtech company that leverages blockchain and artificial intelligence to help governments improve efficiency and trust by increasing transparency and accountability in the allocation of public resources. Using tools in the ETC Labs accelerator, OS City empowers civil servants and citizens in developing countries with access to state-of-the-art technology to track and trace data; using blockchain to validate the work of craftspeople working in far-flung enclaves of the developing world from Latin America to India, China to Malawi.
UNICEF Innovation Fund
At the beginning of this year, ETC Labs teamed up with the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) Innovation Fund by providing $1 million to support various blockchain-based social impact solutions.  Allocating $750,000 to global startup graduates of UNICEFs Innovation Fund and provide $250,000 directly to the Fund itself. Funding provided by ETC Labs helped support various ongoing projects such as W3 Engineers, a Bangladesh-based company that provides connectivity solutions using open-source and blockchain technology in emerging markets that lack Internet or cellular network coverage.
Success, related to social impact using blockchain and regulation
Our approach to social impact is to create financial inclusion. We're trying to do that in a way where regulation can inspire entrepreneurship and innovation with ensuring security and functionality for consumers, said Terry Culver, CEO, ETC Labs.  Having served as an Economic and Technology Policy Advisor for the United Nations and for governments in Ghana, Namibia, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia, India, and Bolivia, among others, Terry is an expert on cryptocurrency and blockchain policy and regulations.
What is abundantly clear is that blockchain use cases have moved beyond pilot stages across the globe and are having real and profoundly positive impacts on peoples lives.  While much attention is given to the money-making machine that is crypto, or indeed the darker side of crypto anonymity, it is deeply encouraging to see real-life examples of positive social impact as a result of calculated and creative blockchain investments.","How exciting is it for you to see mWater appear in an article by Forbes?

270,felise.katz@pkatech.com,"Aruba and World Wide Technology (WWT), No. 9 on the 2020 CRN SP500, have won a blockbuster pact with internet provider Comcast Business on a secure work from home solution for businesses.
The new Comcast Business Teleworker VPN solution, which is powered by the Aruba Edge Services (ESP) platform, provides enterprise class security for work at home.
WWT, the $12 billion solution provider behemoth, one of Aruba and HPE’s top global partners, is a fulfillment partner on the Comcast deal. 
[RELATED: Aruba Networks‘ Keerti Melkote: The Edge Is The ’Exact Opposite’ Of The Cloud]
Aruba and HPE are part of WWT’s Advanced Technology Center (ATC), where customers can evaluate and gain hands-on access to HPE technology including Aruba intelligent edge solutions.
Aruba ESP – which is gaining momentum in the channel- allows partners to centrally manage work at home from a single Aruba Central cloud console. It supports everything from laptops and desktops to VoIP phones and printers in a work at home environment.
Keerti Melkote (pictured), founder and president of Aruba, an HPE company, said he sees a booming work at home opportunity for partners in the wake of the global pandemic. 
Aruba remote access points are the most important product sales opportunity for partners going into the new HPE fiscal year which begins Nov. 1, said Melkote.
“Work from home has become a strategic imperative,” said Melkote in an interview with CRN. “Hybrid work is the way of the the future…Remote AP and the (Aruba) work from home products have become very important in a post pandemic world.”
Aruba has architected the work at home solutions to be set up as virtual gateways using Aruba ESP. “There is not a competitive equivalent in the market right now,” Melkote said
Partnering with internet providers like Comcast, AT&amp;T or Verizon is critical to providing a complete managed service around the Aruba remote access points, said Melkote. The key for MSPs is providing the same “non-stop, WiFi experience that corporations get in the office” at home, said Melkote. “That is very, very important low hanging fruit for partners to go take advantage of,” he said.
The average work at home remote access solution starts at $300 to $500- not including the managed services provided by MSPs, said Melkote.
The MSP call to action is to get educated on the Aruba hybrid work at home solutions and offer it as a managed service, said Melkote.
“Don’t just offer it as a product,” he said. “It has a software component to it. Solution providers can take the remote AP, take a broadband line, take the software to operate it and wrap it together in a managed service. We’ll help them do that.”
Paul Cohen, vice president of sales for New York-based PKA Technologies Inc., an HPE Platinum and Aruba partner, said he sees a significant opportunity teaming with Aruba, targeting corporate work at home initiatives with PKA SolveIT managed service wireless solutions. 
A large percentage of customers moved to work at home solutions that did not meet corporate security and network reliability standards, said Cohen. “A lot of our commercial customers are asking us to do work at home security and network reliability assessments,” he said.
Cohen credited Melkote with continuing to advance the Aruba intelligent edge architecture as best in class against any and all competitors. “Keerti continues to drive innovation at a pace that is difficult for the competiton to keep up,” he said.",I noticed that PKA Technologies' involvement with Aruba and the work at home initiatives must mean a great deal to you!

Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Wiley's vice president of investor relations, Brian Campbell. Please go ahead.
Brian Campbell -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Wiley's first-quarter 2021 earnings update. On the call with me are Brian Napack, president and chief executive officer; and John Kritzmacher, chief financial officer. A few reminders to start.
The call is being recorded and may include forward-looking statements. You shouldn't rely on these statements, as actual results may differ materially and are subject to factors discussed in our SEC filings. The company does not undertake any obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Wiley provides non-GAAP measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends.
These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies, nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under GAAP. Please see the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures presented in the supplementary information included in our press release. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call, and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude the impact of currency, unless otherwise specified.
After the call, a copy of this presentation and a playback of the webcast will be available on our investor relations web page. I'll now turn the call over to Wiley's president and CEO, Brian Napack. 
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Right now, educators and students around the world are heading back to school and researchers are heading back into their labs in a world significantly altered by COVID-19. As they do, they're rewriting the playbooks for education and research. From our vantage point,  It's clear that they're turning to digital content, platforms and services at unprecedented levels, and they're also turning to corporate partners, such as Wiley, who can help them achieve their goals in a changed world.
The result for Wiley is that across the company, demand for our digital products and services has grown markedly. This unusual moment is moving our markets and proving that the strategies that we have been pursuing are not only right for the market today, they are right for where the market is going in the long term. We had a solid first quarter of revenue and earnings performance despite the disrupted environment. This demonstrated both resilience of our business and tight alignment of our strategies with the market's evolving needs.
We'll talk specifics about our performance shortly, but  It's important to note that today's acute health, economic and social problems serve to reinforce the value of Wiley's mission. Over the past months, we've moved faster to validate and publish more research and have made thousands of critical COVID-related research studies freely available. We've helped many universities, schools and corporations around the world to more quickly migrate from traditional to virtual learning. And we spent lots of time in our communities, raised money for causes that address injustice and taking concrete actions to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion within Wiley.
We continue to be reminded of the racial inequality plaguing our society and the need for corporate citizens, such as us, to play an active role in dismantling it. Our global team takes great pride in the fact that their work is truly helping the world to heal, recover, and thrive. Wiley today remains largely in work-from-home mode, although we have partially opened a few offices around the world where local health conditions allow. I want to recognize the great work of our team in executing at a very high level through this challenging period.
Simply stated, the team continues to deliver on our key milestones and customer commitments. In regular surveys, the vast majority of our colleagues report feeling productive and happy, and their engagement is very high. This can be attributed to our strong mission-driven culture, our tech-enabled workflows and our consistent emphasis on colleague care. The pandemic continues to disrupt the global economy, and this has directly impacted some of our more traditional revenue sources, such as physical books and in person training.
But despite these focused headwinds, we're very encouraged by the underlying momentum we're seeing in education and research. This momentum should continue well beyond the pandemic. We've been talking for some time about the positive trends that are driving research and education. Our growth strategy is built on these trends.
I'm pleased to see that they are accelerating at this moment and that Wiley is capitalizing on them. Research output is rising rapidly. Demand for online education and for the digital courseware to support it is also rising rapidly. The acceleration in these areas speaks well to our long-term outlook.
Internally, we are using the moment to lean into our operational excellence. This includes a focus on improving content workflows, our customer journeys our facilities' footprint and more. John will talk about this later, but there is much we have done and much that we continue to do to improve the efficiency of operations. With that, let me summarize the first quarter's results.
As I said, we continue to see COVID-related disruption to printed books and in-person training in the quarter. Offsetting that was strong growth in key strategic areas, including Open Access publishing, research content usage, online student enrollment and digital courseware. The net result was that revenue rose 2%, adjusted EPS rose 124%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 42%. Organic revenue was down 1%.
I'll provide more detail on all of this in our segment discussions. The material earnings improvement this quarter was primarily driven by favorable revenue performance, particularly in Research, lower discretionary spending and savings from restructuring. Corporate expenses alone were down 16% or $7 million. Let's take a look at the segments.
Our research business continues to perform well. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA rose 6 and 19%, respectively. An important note is that about 4 million of our Q1 revenue came from journal subscription renewals that were delayed from Q4 due to COVID-19. That said, our strategies across the Research business continue to bear fruit.
Article output was up 13%. As you know, this is a key driver of our business models.  It's an outcome of good market growth, our strong publishing programs and our market-friendly publishing strategies. We continue to see strong double-digit revenue growth from our open access publishing program.
Our comprehensive national agreements in Europe are performing well with publishing volumes exceeding our expectations. Usage of the Wiley online library is growing strongly, up 10% over prior year. Our industry-leading society publishing program is having another great year. Net society wins will result in around $11 million of incremental publishing revenue in calendar '21.
In June, we signed a 10-year extension of our important Cochrane Library partnership. For reference, Cochrane is the world's preeminent collection of validated evidence for healthcare decision-makers. Our platform revenue rose 10% on new customer launches for Literatum. We continue to consolidate Literatum's industry-leading position in research content distribution, and our customer retention on a trailing 12-month basis was 98%.
Finally, we expanded our partnership with AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is one of the world's largest scientific societies. As part of this, we'll move the full suite of content from science, a globally celebrated family of journals, onto Literatum. This follows our recent announcement that we have also partnered with AAAS to grow their science career center.
I'll provide a bit of forward-looking color for each of our three segments. In research, our strong market position and diversified revenue streams are providing a solid foundation through this time of change. Calendar '20 subscription agreements are locked in through December of this year, and our calendar '21 renewal season just recently started. We do anticipate that COVID-related budget constraints at libraries will result in some price pressure for '21, but  It's too early to quantify.
In any case, we expect to offset this pressure through the continued strong growth of open access, research platforms and corporate solutions. At the same time, we continue to enhance our end-to-end workflows to improve efficiency and enhance the value proposition for researchers. We've made very good progress already, as evidenced in our strong EBITDA performance, reduced publishing cycle times and improved researcher engagement. In summary, we're seeing strong underlying indicators of future growth and long-term customer health.
In academic and professional learning, or APL, the story is an interesting one. The quarter was significantly affected by COVID due to the closure of bookstores, testing centers and corporate offices. Naturally, this affected the more traditional areas of APL, such as print book publishing, Test Prep services and in-person corporate training. The effect was that APL revenue declined 12, 13% organically, and adjusted EBITDA declined 23%.
But despite this short-term pressure, there's good news for the future in our KPIs. We're seeing quite positive trends in digital content and courseware as universities and companies pivot to virtual learning. We appear to be in an inflection point for digital content and digital courseware with record growth of 32 and 88%, respectively, on a pro forma basis. Our strategy to focus tightly on high-demand skills and careers is paying off.
In higher ed, we are gaining market share. Our share has grown from 4% in July 2018 to nearly 5% in July 2020 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our innovative zyBooks and Alta digital offerings are winning adoptions at an impressive pace. For example, zyBooks, our STEM platform, saw revenue double over the prior year, and it is winning consistently in large course adoptions.
So actually, I'm feeling good about the future of APL despite this quarter's COVID-19-related declines in our traditional business lines. For the remainder of the year, we expect that current trends will continue, namely that print book sales will continue to be challenged by COVID lockdowns and virtual learning. Note that print books represent a smaller portion of Wiley's overall business. Digital content and courseware will continue to grow strongly, helping to mitigate any potential decline this fall in higher ed enrollment.
Recovery in test prep will be dependent upon the reopening of testing sites and the resumption of certification exams. In corporate learning, we're seeing an acceleration of our virtual and hybrid corporate training products. We anticipate a strong post-pandemic recovery based upon what we are seeing in platform usage and new partner signings. Throughout APL, we're moving quickly to take advantage of the abrupt shift to digital learning by investing in our platforms and our go-to-market strategies.
This includes our value-driven business models that make content affordable. An example is our Inclusive Access program, which continues to grow very strongly. We are also responding to the moment by publishing timely titles on topics such as running businesses virtually and creating diverse, inclusive and equitable cultures. Finally, we're driving rapid and significant improvement in our cost structure to improve efficiency and our margin profile.
Our education services segment is positioned very well for this moment as universities, students and professionals are pivoting hard to both digital learning and online degrees. It will take time to fully realize the potential of this shift, but interest in our services, which help universities to succeed with online education, is running very high. For the quarter, revenue was up 29%, or 4% organically, and our EBITDA margin was 13%, which is up 9% for fiscal '20. Revenue growth was driven by $12 million of inorganic contribution from M3, as well as 9% growth in student enrollment.
Our mature and new programs are performing well, although organic growth was offset by small partner terminations as part of our continuous portfolio optimization. Our full-service partner count now stands at 67. We added two new full-service university partners in the quarter, the University of New Haven in Connecticut and Carlow University in Pennsylvania, and we signed additional universities for unbundled service agreements. Online program enrollment was very healthy this summer and remains so as we enter the fall semester.
At M3, we found the corporate demand for trained IT talent to be more stable in the pandemic than we had expected. Our existing customer base is solid, and we've begun placing new talent at several recently signed customers. Notably, we're gaining momentum in India where we are currently staffing a major new technology center for one of our global financial services clients. University services are facing significant pressures this year.
Universities are facing significant pressures this year as they simultaneously shift to hybrid and virtual learning while also dealing with financial shortfalls brought on by COVID-related enrollment declines. Although intermediate and long-term trends are very good, there is some near-term uncertainty to manage through with our clients. As with digital courseware, online education is now past the inflection point and is broadly adopted and accepted as a mainstream way to get a degree or certification. This was true before COVID, but the disruption of the past six months has driven home the value of high-quality, fairly priced education that can fit the life and career needs of the broad public.
This moment is reflected in enrollment trends and good pipeline of potential university partnerships, both in the U.S. and abroad and with our key partners, most of whom are evaluating online expansion opportunities. M3's IT talent placement volume is anticipated to be steady for the balance of the year as our corporate partners continue to maintain and grow their tech talent capacity. Major operational focus within education service is the continued improvement of the student journey from lead to enrollment.
These efforts continue to bear fruit in higher conversion rates and lower student acquisition costs. The business is well on track to realize its fiscal '22 goal of the 15% EBITDA margin. I'll now pass the call over to John to take you through our financial profile and optimization initiatives.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Brian. Despite a very challenging environment, we are generally pleased with our revenue and earnings performance for this quarter. That said, our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were unfavorable to prior year by $27 million and $20 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of changes in working capital. As a reminder, our cash flow is normally the use of cash in the first half of our fiscal year due to timing of collection for general subscriptions, which are concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
Capital expenditures, including technology, property and equipment and product development spending, declined $6 million to $24 million for the quarter. As discussed on the last earnings call, we expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, with investment focused on new product and service capabilities, as well as process redesign and workflow automation. With respect to investment in acquisitions, we will remain opportunistic and continue our pursuit of attractive opportunities to add scale and provide enhanced tech-enabled products and services in both research and online education. In terms of our balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was up $117 million primarily due to acquisitions, but our interest expense was lower by $1.5 million as we realized the benefit of the lower interest rate environment.
Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 2.0 times, inclusive of all acquisitions. In terms of access to capital, we reported $101 million of cash on hand, and we ended the quarter with undrawn revolving credit of $650 million. Our strong balance sheet, consistency of annual cash flows and ample liquidity afford us the flexibility to continue investing, acquiring and returning cash to shareholders. In June, the company modestly increased its quarterly dividend for the 27th consecutive year.
Our current dividend yield is more than 4%. As a reminder, due to the economic downturn, we have refrained from repurchasing shares. We remain fully confident in our continued strategic momentum, cash generation and liquidity position, and we expect to resume share repurchases as the economic environment recovers. We are moving quickly on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the adverse impacts of the economic downturn and improve our agility and efficiency.
These programs are companywide and include optimizing our content development workflows, streamlining our customer support operations and achieving benchmark efficiency levels for corporate support functions, such as HR and finance. Meanwhile, we continue to maintain tight controls on discretionary spending across the company, and we have realized significant savings on travel, marketing events and professional fees. In addition, hiring and salary increases have been strictly limited to critical business needs and investment in our top performers. And in June, the executive leadership team and the board unanimously agreed to take six-month pay cuts ranging from 15% to 30%.
And as you may recall, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a $15 million restructuring charge for actions that will generate annual run rate savings of approximately $30 million. Additional cost savings actions are anticipated in the current fiscal year. As an example, we are taking actions to rationalize our real estate portfolio given our successful transition to a virtual work environment. We will update you on our progress as the anticipated savings -- and the anticipated savings we will make throughout the year.
In summary, we are very well positioned to navigate the COVID-related challenges ahead while investing in key optimization and growth initiatives. As a reminder, given our limited visibility in the current economic environment, we have suspended our practice of providing annual guidance. We expect to return to providing guidance when the economic environment becomes more stable and our visibility improves. I'll now pass the call back to Brian.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. So, to recap the main messages for today, our business remains strong through the pandemic with good momentum continuing in both research and education services. We're experiencing COVID-related disruptions to print books and in-person training. Of course, this represents a smaller part of Wiley today, with nearly 80% of our revenue coming from digital products and tech-enabled services.
Core trends remain favorable in Wiley's key strategic areas of focus, such as peer-reviewed research, online education, digital content and courseware. We're taking full advantage of this unusual moment to drive improvement in the cost structure and core functioning of Wiley, focusing on high potential areas, such as our content development workflows, our management of the customer life cycle and the tuning of our real estate footprint for an increasingly virtual workforce. Overall, we're confident in the enduring importance of our Research and Education content, platforms and services. But more importantly, we're optimistic that this challenging moment -- at this challenging moment because we're seeing compelling evidence in our KPIs that our markets are strong and that our strategies are working.
To be specific, we're experiencing strong growth in demand to publish in our journals and consumer research, strong growth in Research platform signings, recurring revenue and content consumption with 98% client retention, strong growth in our digital courseware portfolio, strong growth in enrollment at our online degree programs and increased interest of universities in accelerating the transition to online education. So despite some near-term headwinds, the data tells me that we're tightly aligned with the current and long-term needs of our customers, the researchers, students, professors, administrators and corporate leaders that we serve worldwide. Once again, I want to thank our wonderful Wiley colleagues around the world for their grit, their positive spirit and their remarkable accomplishments this quarter. With that, I'll open the floor to your comments and questions.
Questions &amp; Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with research. Obviously, a really solid growth in a difficult environment.
How much of the jump in article output and content consumption would you contribute to COVID-related research? And as a follow-up, how much of the jump in research revenue and EBITDA reflects things like reprints and back files, open access? Just trying to get a sense for that relative to maybe the kind of legacy Research business, if you will.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll start, and John can chip in. So, we're seeing -- definitely seeing good momentum in Research publishing. The COVID crisis has definitely increased the interest in -- or the output of researchers, and we see no signs of that declining.
With respect to specific COVID-related research, we certainly are publishing more COVID-related papers, as you would expect. But as a percentage of our total,  It's a very small percentage.  It's really a much broader --  It's a much broader increase in demand that we're seeing at this point in time that's coming across the portfolio. And to answer your second question, a large portion of that is coming in open access.
So, we're seeing really good growth rates in our open access pay-to-publish models, which, as you know, is a price times quantity model. So, when that happens, that translates directly into our revenue base. So we're definitely feeling consistent and increasing demand. And the practices that we've taken in the marketplace, which have been very market friendly, we believe, are leading researchers to choose Wiley and choose our journal.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
Indeed. And on OA specifically, is it more article output from the same customers? More interest from new parties? How would you sort of weigh those two?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you know, in Open Access, the researchers themselves are deciding where to submit their articles. And as they do, they're choosing the titles, meaning the journal titles, and the publishers that they want to work with. So, increasingly,  It's almost a B2C model in that case. And so, things like the reputation, the quality of the customer experience, the researcher experience as they go through the publishing process, the speed with which the article gets out and the quality with which it gets promoted are what drives that.
So, we believe that we're seeing researchers choose us, quite simply stated. If that answers your question, Dan. If I didn't answer it specifically, please follow up.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
No, that helps. Absolutely. Maybe one or two quick follow-ups. The -- given the growth in OA, if we were to break down Research between kind of annual contracted revenue versus more variable or consumption-based, what would that look like at this stage percentage-wise?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, currently, as you look at our -- go ahead, John. Yes.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
I'll answer this in a way that is also responsive, Dan, to your question about what was the composition of revenue in the quarter. Roughly speaking, about 80% of our revenue comes from the combination of subscriptions and open access. And within that, call it, 70% of our research publishing business is subscription and about 10% of it is OA. The remaining 20% of our business, Dan, is, frankly, largely products and services that are derivatives of articles that are published under subscription, such as reprints that you mentioned and such as corporate advertising.
So, that's roughly the split of revenue that we have today. And of course, the subscription base is largely contracted, right? So that's well in play, but we're coming up on a renewal season. You asked whether -- you asked about are there significant backhaul revenues or such in the quarter, and the answer to that is no. This was a pretty normal quarter for us in terms of the composition of products and services that drove our revenue.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
That's helpful because that can be really high margin. One more, and I'll jump out. But you alluded, Brian, to obviously the extraordinary pressures that universities will be facing. Given where the stock is and has been trading, I think there's a lot more fear out there than -- well, may or may not warranted, we'll see.
But I know you don't want to get into the guidance, but when you think about Research, is there a range -- I guess, one, how are those initial dialogues going for calendar '21? And two, is there a range of revenue growth that you might be able to -- at an extreme high, extreme low bracket to sort of rein in some of the fears out there? Maybe  It's too early, but I thought I'd give you the opportunity.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah, look, I mean,  It's a completely fair question, and  It's what we want to know as well. We're talking to our customers very, very closely, and we're trying to get a sense of it. But  It's really early in the renewal season, and so it really is too early to tell.
We do expect some price pressure. But we expect that that price pressure should be offset by this strong growth that you're seeing in OA and in platforms and other areas. So, the simple answer is  It's too early to tell but that we believe that the price pressure we face will be modest and that it will be largely offset, if not more than offset, by our open access growth.
Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst
OK. Helpful. I'll follow up with -- jump back in queue with any follow-up.
Operator
Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, Brian, historically, when GDP has fallen and unemployment has risen, enrollment trends have accelerated. And listening to your preamble, it doesn't sound like that's what you're seeing or anticipating for the fall semester, but just want to get more detail around that.
And then, on a related note, the 4% organic growth for Ed Services that you reported in the quarter, is that indicative of what we should anticipate for the balance of fiscal '21? And then, I have a follow-up.
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Got it. So, from the perspective of the demand patterns in higher ed, this -- there's no question that there is a relationship between GDP, unemployment and college enrollment. That -- historically, that relationship has been one with a bit of a lag, a 12 to 18-month lag. And so, we do expect that to play out here, and we believe we're already seeing it in our leads, in our interest and in our enrollment.
But really, traditionally, that's played out over time. What's happening now in enrollment is different than that, though. What's happening now is literally a practical preclusion on universities from running schools as they normally had and a depression or a downward pressure on enrollment that's come from health fears related to being in large groups of people, as everybody knows. So, what we're seeing -- the enrollment pressure we're seeing is not some sort of an inverse relationship to the tradition.
In fact,  It's a novel pressure. And that novel pressure was expected in the fall to be in the neighborhood of 10 or 15%. We think it could be on the lower end of that. But from Wiley's perspective, and this is really important, from Wiley's perspective, our -- and that has -- that, by the way, will affect our principal sales.
But from Wiley's perspective, our strategic growth areas are digital courseware and online education, and those run counter to the trends that we're seeing in the market because if you can't go to school in person, you go online. Or if you're supposed to -- if you're usually in a classroom, but now you're going to be studying from home in a virtual environment, you have no choice but to get the digital materials. You can't share. You can't -- a book is not going to help because you need to be in the courseware.
So, that is contributing to an upswell in the parts of that business that we are strategically focused on in the future. So both in the services business, where we're focused on online enrollment, and in the courseware business or the content business, where we're focused on digital content and courseware, we actually believe that this is a material change that will have a long-term benefit for the business. Then answering second part of your question, we are seeing -- obviously, results are backward-looking. And in the spring, we definitely saw some shock to the system from COVID that affected enrollments.
It just -- this is not surprising. But over this summer, we started to see elevated levels of interest in our -- in lead generation and in conversion, leading to pretty good enrollment trend. So, our enrollment actually was up around 9% recently, and then we should see some of that continue. But again, we're just getting into the semester.
We'll just see exactly how this start goes. And so, we're not at all pessimistic. Quite the contrary, we're optimistic about where that business is going and the enrollment trends due to the things that I've been talking about, both the short-term shift to online translating into a greater acceptance of online learning and online education where it is really is the norm now in many cases for a large portion of people getting postsecondary educations, and then followed by what we expect to be a significant, economically driven increase in interest in education due to the inverse relationship that you identified before between the economy and enrollment in schools.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Got it. OK. Very helpful. And then, I know you spent a lot of time talking about open access, and it, obviously, had a very good quarter.
Just any updated thoughts around the sustainability of that growth? And then, separately, John, can you address the timing-related working capital issues that impacted your cash flow during the quarter?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll pick up the OA question first. We're -- long before COVID, we were seeing significantly greater volumes of submissions and consequent volumes of our output. That has continued and increase through COVID-19.
We see no reason to believe that  It's not going to continue. There might be a slight elevation now that's related to researchers being at home and finishing up papers. You think that would've been done already, and yet the elevated levels continue, and in fact, they're increasing. So, we're very bullish on those volumes levels continuing at a high level on a go-forward basis.
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
And then, Drew, on your question with respect to cash flow and, in particular, the impact of working capital that I referenced in my comments, which were the biggest drivers. I mean, by the way, we had very strong performance in the quarter from a real earnings growth perspective, but then working capital played against us. And in particular, I would note that our cash collections associated with journals were pretty strong and in line with our expectations, so we're feeling good about collections there. We do have some customers that have requested extended terms, but  It's not a material impact to our results, and we feel like that's flowing well.
The most significant impact on the timing of working capital has to do with payables. In the March -- late March and April time frame, like others, we went into a bit of cash conservation mode given potential risks around liquidity in the market at that point in time. And so, we put some pressure on payables at that time. And then, as things began to ease up in our first quarter, we also eased up on payables.
So, the ground that we gave up on cash flow in the quarter is particularly concentrated around payables, and  It's just sort of the normal flow back to a balance after conserving cash at the end of the fourth quarter.
Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
OK. All right guys appreciate it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Sami Kassab with Exane.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
Good morning, Brian. Good morning, John. Thanks for taking my questions, I have three of them, please. The first one is on a topic that I think you've just touched on, but I would kindly like you to perhaps elaborate a little bit more.
On open access, what's the risk that the elevated levels of submissions that we've seen actually reflect the fact that scientists have been locked down at home and away from their labs and had a lot of time to write papers but had no ability to make progress on their scientific research and that those three, four months will actually, six months, 12 months down the road, will lead to a slowdown in open access growth as science did not really happen through the lockdowns? Secondly, on China, we've seen the Chinese government communicate new research appraisal policies, pushing Chinese scientists to publish more into Chinese local language journals, [Inaudible] moving away from splicing. Do you think the China policy and regulatory changes may have an impact, or is that too small to matter? Is that not something that is big on your radar screen? Then lastly, can you elaborate a little bit on how you see the regulatory environment in OPM? We've had the likes of Bob Sherman and Senator Warren look at OPM. Do you think the regulatory environment could be at risk of changing? Or do you think  It's a solid regime that you have today and you have no major concerns on the regulatory front for OPM?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you very much for asking three questions, each of which is a dissertation. So, I'll take them one at a time. They're very good questions, excellent questions that I'd be asking if I were you. So the first one, on the risk of the elevated level of OA sort of bringing back to some lower level later, we are now six or more months into this pandemic; seven or eight, depending on where you're looking in the world.
We continue to see elevated levels. We continue to see researchers putting out papers. Researchers are going back into the labs, absolutely. And so, we're -- we expect it to continue at some level.
Could it come back a little bit? Of course, it could. We're at a very high level right now. But I will remind you that trends in research are very, very positive in terms of overall increasing volume of output in the marketplace. So, in other words, we see mid to high-single-digit increases in the volume of papers every year.
And that long preceded the environment. We consider that will continue in the future. The second thing is that the research continues to be something that is funded at a very high level. In countries around the world, we see no we see no signs of that declining.
So, yeah, I mean, there's no question that there could be a little bit of an artificial increase, but those artificial -- those increases have continued for quite some time now. The final thing I'd say on that is we believe that our publishing program and our approach to publishing is extremely researcher and market friendly, and we think we're getting more than our fair share of submissions. I'll also remind you that of all the submissions we get, we publish a very small portion of them, and so there's always increasing potential there. So, no, I don't see a snapback or a rebound that goes the wrong way on us in the future.
Now, the question of China, another really good question. China is a super important market in the future of research. China is a very important producer and consumer of research. China represents around 5% of our research publishing business now.
So, from a business perspective,  It's not going to swing us one way or the other in any given quarter, but it is very important in the long run, and we are -- and the increasing discussion in China about their endemic -- or indigenous publishing is certainly an important move and important trend. But we have very, very close relationships in China. We have a very good connection to the government agencies and so forth there, and we continue to stay very close to them. Chinese researchers want their journals to be in the best journals in the world so that they can get the recognition and the -- for their work that they desire, and we believe our publishing portfolio leads us there.
But also, we are increasingly partnering in China to make sure that we are seen as the publisher of choice. So, while there is some -- there's always some concern when there are discussions going on in places like China about changes in policy, we believe that, ultimately, we're very well positioned to capitalize on what is still continuing significant growth in both Chinese publishing and Chinese consumption. On the --

Sorry, may I squeeze in a follow-up before we move to OPM? In subscription unbundling and sub has seen some strong takeup, a third of R1 universities on unsub within less than a year. Do you see a trend or risk toward more unbundling of the big deals, especially in the U.S. as universities face budgetary pressure?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So, if the question is about unbundling and whether we are seeing more or we'll be seeing more, as universities face pressure, they certainly are looking for ways to save cost. I've said we can't really comment on what we expect that pricing pressure to be. But as we look into the market, we don't see a lot of evidence.
We see some one-off cases, but we don't see a lot of evidence of universities and university librarians saying we don't need that content, our researchers don't need it, we're not using it. So, to the extent that we have a high -- which we do, a very high-quality portfolio of journals that is essential to the success of research, we will continue to be purchased by those universities. I'll remind you that academics make their careers based upon research, and universities climb the rankings or to descend in the rankings based upon their positioning in the research ecosystem and both the volume and the quality of their output. So, research and research content is absolutely central to the success of our important clients.
So, while we may see some edge cases because, to be sure, there's pressure in the marketplace, we don't see any sort of any evidence of a large-scale trend toward unbundling. OK. And let me move toward OPM. So, the conversation about OPM has gone on for a long time, and the conversation about the revenue share model has gone on for a long period of time.
We start from the position that we have excellent relationships, long-term relationships with our universities, and we help those universities fundamentally to succeed. We help them to succeed by providing extremely high-quality programs, by attracting students and by matriculating those students at extremely high completion rates, higher completion rates than typically they see in their on-ground programs. So, insofar as we are doing that, we are helping those universities to succeed. There has long been a conversation about the revenue share model.
Our clients seem to be fine with it. Now, to be sure, there will be some movement in the marketplace there, and therefore, Wiley has adopted again, as we always do, very market friendly practices of working with universities on terms that they believe are fair. And we have our bundled revenue share model businesses, we have our fee-for-service businesses and so forth. So, we believe wherever the market goes, we're going to be fine.
Having said that, we participate very closely in the discussions that go on in Washington and elsewhere on the future of education, generally speaking, and on the future of of higher ed and its relationship with service providers. So, we've responded to the various inquiries. They have been ongoing. We expect them to continue to be ongoing.
But we're very close to it, and we are not -- our confidence in the future is based upon the fact that we're in a consensual relationship, if you call it, with our partners, who are getting a tremendous amount out of it. If we, together, or if they decide they want to go in a different direction, we're very happy to go in a different direction with them, and we always have been. So we don't view it as a major threat.  It's something to be talked about,  It's something to be studied,  It's something to be adapted to.
But we are confident in our position and, more importantly, the position and the quality of the services and the value of the services that we provide to the marketplace.
Sami Kassab -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst
This is fantastic and all very convincing. You said in your opening remarks that you had higher completion rates. Did you mean that your OPM program has higher completion rate than equivalent on-campus programs have?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Typically speaking, our programs -- I will say, our programs have very high completion rates for the students that start and those that complete the program. I'll remind you that, historically, when the industry has come under pressure, it has been for universities and education providers that have had extremely low completion rates, such that students started but they never finished and, therefore, never got value for the education that they paid for or that somebody else, such as the government or the taxpayer, paid for. That is absolutely not the case in our programs. The completion rates are extremely high, and our clients are happy with them.
And, clearly, students are happy with them because they're staying through to completion and achieving career outcomes that perpetuate the demand for the product.

Our next question comes from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen. Prior to COVID, rearing its ugly head, margins were eroding. Was that from your conversion from hard copy to digital, or did it relate to state cutbacks in education?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
John, do you want to pick that up?
John Kritzmacher -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, just generally, looking back over fiscal year '20, we did see some erosion of our margin. I would say that the most significant drivers behind that erosion of margin were two. One was the rapid -- continued rapid decline of print, which has reasonably good margins.
But print, as we know, is in decline, and that rate of decline got a bit faster in the past fiscal year and had an impact on our bottom line. We're taking actions, as we discussed in today's review, to improve the profitability of that business by focusing and by, in particular, focusing our future on digital courseware and digital content. The second factor that contributed overall to the shift in the blended margin of the business, there's an increased component of our revenue coming from OPM business that we just talked about. And we recognize that in its current state, the market itself in its current state that operating margins are low.
But we've been emphasizing that we are balancing between top line growth, which is very important to us, and improving profitability there. And we said that we would drive that business to 15% EBITDA margin by next year, and we're well on the march to get there. But those are the two factors that have been putting pressure on our margin, and both of them are being addressed.
Brett Reiss -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
If going forward, there are continued high levels of unemployment, is that a tailwind in that there's a tendency for enrollments in school to go up in that kind of macroeconomic environment?
Brian Napack -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I'll pick that back up, John. As I was indicating earlier, there is a long term -- and in fact, I think it was either Dan or Drew that pointed it out, there is a long-term established pattern of when the economy goes down and unemployment goes up, that people go back to school. That relationship is typically a lagged relationship, meaning it happens not instantly, it happens 12 to 18 months later, and we do expect to see that.
But we have other tailwinds that are hitting us right now, which is simply that people can't go to school in person. They're physically precluded from going to school fully in person. And so, therefore, we have elevated levels of interest from potential students in taking education in an online world. It also is providing a tailwind, as I indicated earlier, to our digital courseware businesses, which, as I indicated in my remarks, are seeing record increases in usage and adoption because again, if you're not in a physical setting, you need a learning management system based product, something that -- where your teacher can make assignments, where you can do homework, where you can get the content predictably, the content that the teacher needs, not have to Google for your curriculum.
And physical books just aren't as good in those environments. They don't do all those things. And so, there's a significant tailwind that hits you in that sense. And, again, as I indicated, the -- we believe that these are accelerations of long-term trends so that it won't be a short-term blip.
We believe that we're going to see continued elevation of those levels, which is completely -- all of these trends that I'm talking about are completely in sync and aligned with our strategy that we've been working on for the last few years. And  It's gratifying to see it start to come to fruition at a time when the world needs both education and research more than ever.

258,theresa@zylo.com,"We know that a lot of elements go into the formation of a startup ecosystem. When your city is outside of the major coastal tech centers, it takes a deliberate effort to get such a system off the ground. For Indianapolis, Indiana, it started with the creation of ExactTarget in 2000. When that company was sold to Salesforce for $2.5 billion in 2013, it helped bring a bushel of cash into the startup system.
Today, the venture capital firm that connects back to that ExactTarget acquisition, High Alpha Capital, announced a new $110 million fund. The company concentrates on B2B SaaS startups. Kristian Andersen, partner and co-founder at High Alpha sees the fund in the context of the pandemic and the changes it has brought to how businesses are run.
“We are living in a [time] of almost unrivaled disruption, which has created a host of challenges for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. In spite (or possibly because) of those challenges, we’re more confident and motivated than ever to help support the next generation of founders as they seek to transform the world through the marriage of entrepreneurship and technology,” Anderson said.
Of course, cash is a key ingredient in any startup system recipe. ExactTarget’s founders were flush with it after the acquisition and Scott Dorsey, one of the firm’s founders says they wanted to build a system from the ground up that included education, a system to encourage entrepreneurship, math skills, a pool of engineering talent and of course, a venture capital firm to drive investment.
“I think of the recipe as talent, capital, support and mentorship. So talent has to be a sharp focus, which is certainly is for us at High Alpha and across the Indianapolis market. The second piece is capital, and markets like Indy often don’t have access to capital and that’s been important that we’re raising our own funds,” he said.
He added, “Thirdly, I think  It's just support and mentorship and that’s really what High Alpha is built to do. We have 40 of us on the team with SaaS experts across design, marketing, product engineering, finance and HR —  all Centers of Excellence you need to start and scale a SaaS company,” he said.
The firm is divided into two parts. The first is High Alpha Studio, which is a kind of incubator for really early stage founders and the second is High Alpha Capital, which is the focus of today’s announcement.
This is third fund for the company. The first was High Alpha One worth $21 million. The second one, High Alpha Two was worth $85 million. Combined with today’s announcement, the total raised across the three funds is $216 million. While the first two funds’ investments were mostly in the Indy area, the plan with the newest one is to expand beyond the region with at least some of the investments.
The firm concentrates on enterprise B2B SaaS companies from pre-seed through Series A investments, so concentrating on early stage companies that it can help nurture and learn from their experiences building ExactTarget into a successful company.
Among the companies they invested in include Attentive, SalesLoft, Zylo, Terminus, The Mom Project, Lessonly, LogicGate, MetaCX and Socio.",I noticed Zylo when reading about High Alpha Capital's recent raise of their new $110 fund.

257,justin.shriber@people.ai,"From each of our twoexperiences starting out as introductory-level engineers at Box, to becoming first-time managers overseeing five-person teams, then directors overseeing 30-50, and ultimately VPs managing hundreds, we've experienced software engineering from every angle.
At every step of the way, we asked ourselves: ""how do we know if we are bringing value as engineering leaders?"" Effective leadership uniquely blends human qualities - influence, empathy, courage, and results. This latter quality always brings the question of productivity - how effective are you at producing results through enabling others?
Since the advent of the software industry, most engineering teams have seen productivity as a black box. Only recently have people even begun to build internal tools that optimize performance. Unfortunately, most of these tools measure the wrong metrics and are shockingly similar across companies. We even built some of these tools and made mistakes. Now, we'd like to share the way forward. 
Engineering Effectiveness is Behind the Times 
Engineering teams are both the most expensive and most fundamental part of tech companies. As more companies become tech-enabled, the importance of engineering will only increase. Yet today, a full three decades after the advent of the internet, most engineering departments still rely exclusively on qualitative signals of performance.
The evolution of engineering effectiveness is paralleling the spirit of sales' recent transformation. In the early 2000s, sales was considered an art, so sales leaders could skate by on charisma alone. Today, with tools like Salesforce, Clari, and People.ai, sales has fully executed the transition toward scientific, metric-based leadership for analyzing and improving performance.
In the coming years, engineering will adopt a similar, data-driven mode of management. In making this transition, however, most engineering teams are making these mistakes:
Mistake #1: Measuring Approximations of Output
In their haste to become more data-driven, many engineering leaders are measuring their team's performance based on metrics intended to approximate output. These metrics fail because they encourage engineers to game the system.
If you measure a fixed metric like lines of code or number of tickets closed, your engineers will begin splitting code into more lines or breaking bug fixes into multiple tickets. Even sprint points, which attempt to convert engineering work into a standard unit, suffer from this pitfall: Some engineers will slow down after reaching their sprint points for the week while others will strategically inflate their tasks to be awarded additional points.
Experienced engineers will recognize that this type of measurement is fake. While they may not be as influenced to ""play the game,"" their morale will plummet and they will self-select out. By rewarding approximated metrics of output, you're encouraging engineers to increase them regardless of how they correlate with software development success.
No matter which metrics you choose, abstract output approximations will distract engineers from their actual jobs, ultimately decreasing both your team's effectiveness and morale.
Mistake #2: Not Measuring Anything
On the other end of the spectrum sit engineering leaders who avoid measurement entirely. Many of these leaders have heard about the dangers of measuring the wrong metrics and therefore ricochet to the other extreme. They may emphasize the artisanal and social dimensions of engineering, claiming ""software engineering is too complex to measure.""
Non-measurement can even be self-reinforcing, because it places the leader into the position of being ""the good guy."" Instead of being a metrics-obsessed big brother, the leader can be the friendly older brother exclusively focused on keeping their team happy.
Non-measurement fails because it prioritizes politics over productivity. If you don't measure any metrics, your engineering leaders will simply justify failures, telling stories like ""The customer didn't give us the right requirements"" or ""We were surprised by unexpected vacations."" Software development is complex enough that something always goes wrong; if you don't measure any data, you're at the mercy of individual stories.
Non-measurement unfairly rewards people with charisma while productive but less-persuasive engineers wallow in frustration.
At some point, your top performers will see through these political machinations and quit because your culture lacks accountability.
In the short term, non-measurement can have a positive effect on team morale but it destroys morale in the long-term, especially among high performers. 
The Solution: Measure Blockers at the Team Level 
Instead of measuring some approximation of engineering output, software teams should measure actual, observable metrics that directly correlate to effectiveness.
Productivity is a relationship between inputs and output. In software development, the inputs are a blend of factors--technical, individual, human, etc.--while the output should be functional software that creates value for customers. Productivity in engineering therefore naturally increases when you remove the blockers getting in the way of your team.
Why You Should Measure Blockers
Even at the beginning of the software revolution, there existed the notion that engineers should be nurtured. Starting with Microsoft in the '80s, tech companies gave engineers free resources (like food and gyms) that would remove blockers to their work. Empirical management practices over the last forty years have reinforced the importance of ""servant leadership"" and ""unblocking your team,"" while recent research emphasizes the importance of optimized inputs and best practices.
For engineers, these inputs include:
<ul><li>Quality of developer tools</li><li>Frequency and quality of internal activities (like meetings or code reviews) </li><li>Focused maker time (free from disruptive meetings)</li><li>Easy access to documentation</li><li>Psychological safety on the team</li><li>Work-life balance</li><li>Presence of other high-performers </li><li>A fair system of rewards</li></ul>The blockers to these inputs already exist and can be quantified, such as:
<ul><li>How much free, uninterrupted time does an engineer have to code?</li><li>How long is an engineer waiting on a response from another engineer's review?</li><li>How often do dev tools get in the way instead of helping accelerate work? </li><li>How often are engineers required to context switch, preventing deep work?</li><li>How often do engineers receive pages outside of business hours, interrupting their sleep or family life?</li></ul>An engineering leader exists to enable their team to achieve their goals. Together, these quantified blockers allow engineering leaders to answer key questions like:
<ul><li>What is preventing the engineers from building faster?</li><li>What issues are arising in real time?  </li><li>What technology or process investments would increase team engagement?</li></ul>Each engineering team is unique, so its blockers will be specific.  It's not so simple as ""more maker time is better."" If your engineering team is new or temporarily misaligned on key goals, more meeting time might be the answer. What never changes is the need for measurement and well-considered, deliberate decisions.
Over the last year, COVID-19 has helped demonstrate the value of measuring blockers. For many leaders running newly remote teams, new blockers have arisen that would never have been noticed if managers were only focusing on the desired outcome.
If your team is full of competent, driven engineers, removing their blockers is the fastest way to enable forward movement.
Why ""Team"" is the Right Level to Improve
Since software development requires complex interaction between team members, it would be inappropriate to assign individuals their own metrics: Some engineers are effective individual contributors while others enable their teammates to perform. Engineers also hate being micromanaged, so tracking individual activity can make them feel untrusted.
Just as a sports team wins or loses together, so too should the engineering team be treated as the fundamental unit of success.
Approaching engineering at the team level also places the proper accountability on the manager. It raises helpful questions like ""What behaviors, structures, and work habits are preventing us from succeeding?""
Looking at the team level also enables managers to catch blockers as they evolve. Small issues, for instance, may not be apparent when the company is young, but can evolve into 10,000 papercuts only apparent at the team level. If code reviews take days instead of hours, at first one engineer complains, then two, then three... and if you don't pay attention, years later the engineering culture is shot. By compiling these small quantifications and observing their trends, a manager can understand whether a report is one individual's experience or truly relevant to the overall performance of the team.
Perhaps most important, if blockers follow a constant evolution (e.g. one person is often the canary in the coalmine), an engineering leader can map how the new blockers are likely to evolve and prioritize which should be solved first.
Just as an airplane pilot must monitor dozens of different metrics to keep the plane flying, so too would an engineering leader benefit from viewing their team's metrics to understand overall performance.
In an optimal engineering dashboard, a leader would be able to assess the blockers that prevent the ultimate success of their team. 
Toward Engineering Effectiveness 
""Productivity"" is an appropriate measure for someone making widgets at a factory: ""How many products did you produce in an hour?""
Engineering should instead be about effectiveness: ""How able is this engineer to effect positive impact?""
Looking forward, engineering effectiveness will have three parts:
<ol><li>Measuring the experience of engineering teams in their most frequent activities. (Think distributed tracing, but for human activities.)</li><li>Using the results of those measurements to quantitatively improve the developer experience.</li><li>The final result will take care of itself. (As Jeff Bezos or legendary football coach Bill Walsh would agree, through a better usage of inputs, the output will improve.)</li></ol>If you're an engineering leader, here are a few tips to get started right away: 
<ol><li>Look at your team's calendars:<ul><li>Do people have enough blocks of uninterrupted time to execute complex and intellectually rewarding tasks?</li><li>How much of the meeting load was created by you, the engineering leader?</li><li>Are there recurring meetings that could be done asynchronously?</li><li>Are the same people always asked to perform all the interviews?</li></ul></li><li>Check your team's Git logs:<ul><li>Are most code reviews taking less than a day or can you find very long or even stale code reviews?</li><li>Are remote parts of the team getting the same review treatment or do they have to wait longer than their local counterparts?</li><li>Are people adjusting to long review cycles by opening many tracks of work at once (which is bad for focus)?</li></ul></li><li>Survey your team:<ul><li>Are they happy with the tooling or is it getting in their way?</li><li>How do they feel about pages and alerting? Is it affecting their personal lives?</li></ul></li><li>Finally, turn all these questions into metrics.<ul><li>Pick goals and commit to improving the most urgent blockers.</li><li>Share the dashboard of these metrics with the team.</li></ul></li></ol>In all these cases, the right solution will be up to the manager. For example, if meetings are the issue, perhaps they should be later in the day, more clumped together, or eliminated altogether: once you've found the blocker,  It's the manager's job to improve.
By quantifying blockers and focusing on the team, engineering leaders can transform their department into a data-driven practice that enables everyone's success.
Engineers will become more focused and engaged, managers will become more effective and empathetic, and companies will build faster with higher quality. Engineering will rise to a whole new level.",How do you feel about the current culture of software engineering? I'm interested to hear your thoughts on how to improve sales team effectiveness.,
256,matt@logrocket.com,"In an unprecedented year that saw many teams shift to remote working, we asked tech and business leaders to pick their essential tools.
Throughout our Leaders Insights series on Siliconrepublic.com last year, we asked a host of tech and business leaders from Ireland and further afield to name the essential tools and resources that get them through the working week.
In a year that brought major disruption to most of our working lives, they turned to video conferencing, collaboration software and a whole lot of coffee.
Handy hardware
The move away from offices means many of us are now relying on tech devices for both work and keeping in touch. Seán Keating of Vilicom said his number-one tool is his smartphone. Its like the Swiss army knife of business tools. It keeps me on schedule, navigates to meetings, runs all our most important business apps, connects my laptop to our IT cloud, enables our Teams communications and more.
HPs Gary Tierney said that his phone and laptop are the must-have items for work, but since the arrival of Covid-19 he has been relying more on his laptop. Ive found that working from home has put an even greater emphasis on the criticality of my PC as a communication tool and a general workhorse.
Many people also had to figure out a new at-home work set-up last year. I recently invested in a 38-inch ultra-wide monitor and its been a game changer for me, Joe Lennon of Workvivo told us over the summer.
Video conferencing
2020 was the year we all became very familiar with Zoom (as well as Zoombombing and Zoom fatigue).
Amy Bunszel of Autodesk said she now spends most of her day on Zoom, and Patrick Horgan of Horizon8 said tools such as Zoom are proving incredibly helpful in the work-from-home dynamic.
But there are plenty of other alternatives out there. Microsoft Teams was highlighted as an essential daily tool by plenty of people, including SL Controls Keith Moran, CWSIs Ronan Murphy and Avanades Graham Healy.
Martin McKay of Texthelp said he couldnt be without the Google Meet and Chat tools at the moment, and Xilinxs Brendan Farley said Skype and Webex are other options being used for video calls.
Online collaboration tools are integral to not just our success but our basic functioning, added Ogie Sheehy of ViClarity. Whether it is Zoom or GoToMeeting, Google Chat or Microsoft Teams, these tools are enabling us to continue to work uninterrupted across a global footprint. 
Software saviours
While Microsoft Teams has seen a sharp rise in users in the past year, many companies have been relying on other products from the Microsoft 365 stack. Ronan Murphy of CWSI said these tools allow his company to do whatever we need to do from wherever we are.
SoftwareOnes Una Keeshan said she uses the focus plan in Microsoft MyAnalytics to set aside time for priority work, while Avanades Graham Healy said he uses Microsoft Dynamics for customer relationship management and Power BI for reporting, forecasting and analytics.
With teams dispersed, messaging and collaboration tools such as Slack also came to the fore. Its a convenient way to collaborate over projects and to organise ourselves according to different topics and business functions, said Oz Alashe of CybSafe.
Collaboration tools have always been important for developers. Joe Lennon of Workvivo said GitHub is fundamental for his engineering team to manage source code and code reviews, and they regularly use Tuple to do remote pair programming.
Jennifer Sethre of Intry said Intercom and LogRocket are important tools for her HR tech company, and Keith Moran of SL Controls turns to the Frankli platform for engaging with his team.
Lettertecs Frank Kelly uses Google Keep for jotting quick notes down as they occur, while ViClaritys Ogie Sheehy is a fan of the voice dictation app on his iPhone. It allows me to be immediately responsive to important emails that come through when I am out and about and away from my desk, he said.
A good old-fashioned to-do list
While there may be a fancy tech tool for everything, many leaders still rely on a simple to-do list to keep focused. Nessa McEniff of Learnovate said listing her priorities is a key part of the week and shes a bit of an obsessive list maker.
Netssos Brian ODoherty added that a having a clear list keeps him grounded. I set myself a weekly list and find that its a great way of keeping the faith in myself, my work and my ambitions, he said.
But Liz Cunningham of Google said she is still looking for the perfect tool that will manage all her to-do lists across personal and work life to help keep all the balls in the air.
PayPals Annette Hickey noted that her calendar helps keep her focused throughout the week, and Dells Jason Ward said an organised calendar is key to ensuring I am as productive as possible.
Keeping the mind clear
The sudden shift to remote working means that many have had to find new ways to focus, while still maintaining a good work-life balance and not overworking now that your kitchen may be your office.
To help with this, Nicole Sahin of Globalization Partners said she keeps Fridays free of Zoom meetings. Its like heaven to have that time to think and get things done.
Similarly, Codemas Donna Gartland said that, since the shift to working from home, she now blocks time in her calendar each week without meetings to focus and get deep work done. I use distraction blockers across all my devices, she added, such as Stay Focusd on my browser and Focus mode on Pixel.
Xilinxs Brendan Farley said he removed the work email app from his phone many years ago, which helps him switch off in the evenings. And Mark Cockerill of ServiceNow suggested having a great Spotify playlist on hand.
Getting away from the desk
For minding mental and physical health, many other leaders also suggested getting out and about. SL Controls Keith Moran enjoys a good game of squash in the evening, Arkphires Paul Nannetti tries to run on the beach a few times a week, and Fenergos Louise OConnell said that yoga or a walk in the fresh air can help to just clear the mind.
Una Keeshan of SoftwareOne has recently taken tennis back up as a hobby. The tennis is not only great exercise, she said, but also helps me clear my head from work or the stresses of the day.
And Autodesks Amy Bunszel said that, now she doesnt have a commute for the time being, its a bit easier to make time for exercise every morning and a nice dinner in the evening.
Food certainly plays a key part in the day for many. Horizon8s Patrick Horgan said the barbecue has proved an essential tool for bringing his family together in the current environment.
And one of the essential tools to get Dells Jason Ward through the week? Coffee, coffee and more coffee.",I read an article recently where someone listed LogRocket as an important tool in their HR tech company. I would love to learn more about LogRocket and the importance you bring to other HR tech companies!,
255,sam@madkudu.com,"Responding quickly to incoming leads can make or break a deal, particularly in highly competitive markets. The more mature a business gets, and the more complex the prospective customers needs are, the more challenging it is to maintain that speedy response and personalized touch.
Quickly growing businesses require more sophisticated automation to ensure operational efficiency, proper distribution of leads among their sales team, and to make sure no leads slip through cracks.
Thats what makes lead routing a critical component to any scaling sales strategy.
At its most fundamental, lead routing is the process of automatically assigning leads across a sales team, or through the proper sales model if your company has more than one sales approach, like self-serve, transactional, and enterprise.
Automated lead routing can be simple, such as a round-robin assignment to your sales reps based on who is next in line. Mature lead routing models take multiple factors into account, like deal value, territory or geography, use case or specialization, or a combination of multiple factors by alead scoring system.
Unless youre in a highly niche industry, chances are your business attracts more than one type of customer. Lead routing helps make sure the right prospects reach the right people, and at the right time, saving your business time and resources.
Lead Routing by Value
Companies like Slack and Dropbox popularize the hybrid approach ofbuilding a self-serve business in tandem with an enterprise one. This approach maximizes operational efficiency by keeping the most expensive resource - the sales reps time - focused on building relationships and closing larger deals while routing smaller deals to a low-touch, high volume, one-to-many sales model.
Tools likeClearbit can help pull in data about customers company size and value to pre-populate CRM data. Using this data, low-value leads can be handled by self-serve marketing automation (with a human touch provided by customer support teams answering incoming questions). High-value leads can be sent directly to sales teams to guide high value, complex deals through an enterprise sales process.
Lead Routing by Territory or Geography
For industries tied to brick-and-mortar stores or geographical locations, like manufacturing or real estate, defining territories is a common practice. Leads are assigned by location, enabling sales teams to divide and conquer regionally. Routing leads by geography provides certainty that reps arent stepping on each others toes with double coverage in some areas, while completely neglecting others.
For lead routing by territory to work, you must first define your territories and organize your CRM data around those definitions. With the right CRM and automated toolset, you can sort records into territories and assign leads to any reps working within that territory using round-robin automation.
Lead Routing by Use Case or Specialization
Many tools and systems, especially in SaaS, have multiple relevant use cases. A tool like HubSpot, for example, serves customer service teams, sales teams, and marketing teams, which all come with their own buyer personas, choosers, users, and influencers. Flexible tools like Trello might be used for anything from wedding planning to software bug triage.
Savvy sales teams know that industry expertise helps establish the trusted advisor relationship requisite to closing the big deals, which makes lead routing by specialization or use case increasingly important for enterprise sales models.
Lets take an example of software targeted to creative firms, encompassing graphic design, animation, film editing, and illustration. Its unlikely all sales reps will develop the expertise needed to speak to the needs of all of those varied professionals, even if they do sit under a similar umbrella.
Instead, you may have your top sales reps cover the largest deals that involve multiple products across a company, but route smaller, more specialized deals to reps who specialize in a particular area. Reps that specialize in the graphic design product can handle all deals that come in with that interest as an entry point, whereas those who specialize in the animation product speak to the animation firms who are interested.
Lead Routing by Lead Score
The most sophisticated sales models implementlead scoring as part of their lead routing process. Lead scoring assigns a quantifiable value to every lead generated for the business, usually by a numerical point system.
Leads can be scored on multiple attributes, including a combination of previously mentioned qualities such as value, geography, and use case, but also on qualities like engagement with your company and brand to assess the strength of the leads likelihood to close.
Lead scoring helps sales teams prioritize leads, and apply a more tailored approach to engagement, thereby closing more leads with less effort. Lead scoring can also help define whether a lead needsmore time being nurtured, could close with a low-touch one-to-many approach, or requires the high-touch consultative efforts of a dedicated sales rep.
Route only those with scores ready for sales to your sales team to not only maximize time and efforts. This results in a happy and productive sales team by minimizing the frustration of poor leads.
How to Get Started
Getting started with lead routing is simpleif you have the right tools, including a CRM with automation capabilities and a tool for lead scoring such as HubSpot partner MadKudu.
To develop lead rotation, you will need to:
<ol><li>Define your lead routing criteria, like value, use case, territory, or lead score</li><li>Create workflows or automations based on that criteria</li><li>Qualify leads, which can also be done with lead scoring, and rotate between your reps</li></ol>Setting up the automation with the proper toolset is easy, but theres more to setting lead routing on autopilot when it comes to building a successful sales strategy.
In order to improve and optimize your lead routing, you need to know whats working and whats not. Monitor and report on the successes or shortcomings of routing by certain criteria to understand why routing and segmenting by some criteria work better than others for your sales team, customers, and product. Automated lead routing makes it easy to experiment and shift gears, so you can zero in on the most effective approach for your business.

253,uri@toriihq.com,"Today, that software is offered as a cloud service should be pretty much considered a given. Certainly any modern tooling is going to be SaaS, and as companies and employees add services, it becomes a management nightmare. Enter Torii, an early stage startup that wants to make it easier to manage SaaS bloat.
Today, the company announced a $10 million Series A investment led by Wing Venture Capital with participation from prior investors Entree Capital, Global Founders Capital, Scopus Ventures and Uncork Capital. The investment brings the total raised to $15 million, according to the company. Under the terms of the deal, Wing partner Jake Flomenberg is joining the board.
Uri Haramati, co-founder and CEO, is a serial entrepreneur who helped launch Houseparty and Meerkat. As a serial founder, he says that he and his co-founders saw first-hand how difficult it was to manage their companies’ SaaS applications and the idea for Torii developed from that.
“We all felt the changes around SaaS and managing the tools that we were using. We were all early adopters of SaaS. We all [took advantage of SaaS] to scale our companies and we felt the same thing: The fact is that you just can’t add more people who manage more software, it just doesn’t scale,” Haramati told me.
He said they started Torii with the idea of using software to control the SaaS sprawl they were experiencing. At the heart of the idea was an automation engine to discover and manage all of the SaaS tools inside an organization. Once you know what you have, there is a no-code workflow engine to create workflows around those tools for key activities like onboarding or offboarding employees.

The approach seems to be working. As the pandemic struck in 2020, more companies than ever needed to control and understand the SaaS tooling they had, and revenue grew 400% YoY last year. Customers include Delivery Hero, Chewy, Monday.com and Palo Alto Networks.
The company also doubled its employees from a dozen they started last year with with plans to get to 60 people by the end of this year. As they do that, as experienced entrepreneurs Haramati told me they already understood the value of developing a diverse and inclusive workforce, certainly around gender. Today, the team is 25 people with 10 being women and they are working to improve those ratios as they continue to add new people.
Flomenberg invested in Torii because he was particularly impressed with the automation aspect of the company and how it took a holistic approach to the SaaS management problem, rather than attempting to solve one part of it. “When I met Uri, he described this vision. It was really to become the operating system for SaaS. It all starts with the right data. You can trust data that is gathered from [multiple] sources to really build the right picture and pull it together. And then they took all those signals and they built a platform that is built on automation,” he said.
Haramati admits that  It's challenging to scale in the midst of a pandemic, but the company is growing and is already working to expand the platform to include product recommendations and help with compliance and cost control.",I wanted to say that I am really impressed with your business model and idea on an automation engine that can discover and manage all the SaaS tools being used inside any organization! ,
252,kurt@emplify.com,"Leaders need to double-down on feedback, growth, and mission with remote workers.
SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images
2020 has marked the start of a new era of leadership in many companies. While the hallmarks of good leadershiplike empathy and emotional intelligencetranscend the boundaries of physical offices, leading well remotely has a different set of challenges than leading well in-person. Have newly remote leaders risen to the occasion? To answer this question, Emplify recently surveyed one thousand employees that have only been working remotely full-time since the start of the pandemic.
First, the good news. Half of survey respondents said that their managers level of trust in them has increased since working remotely, and 88 percent shared that their relationship with their manager has either stayed the same or improved. It seems that leaders are also learning to flex their empathy muscles, as 74 percent believe that their manager cares about their mental and emotional well-being. 
But the survey also reveals that remote leaders need to level up in several critical areas. While fewer people are open to new job opportunities than this time in 2019, 65 percent would still consider switching jobs if an opportunity presented itself. To retain their best employees and differentiate in a remote-first work environment, remote leaders need to overcome three common mistakes, and fast.
Mistake #1: Not providing enough constructive feedback. 
When Emplify deployed its survey at the end of October, 67 percent reported that their manager hadnt given them any constructive feedback in the last 30 days. Most of the time, leaders struggle to give constructive feedback for three reasons:
1.    Lack of clarity - The manager doesnt have a clear understanding of how the employee is performing
2.    Lack of competence - The manager doesnt know how to give feedback effectively
3.    Lack of courage - The manager is afraid to give feedback for fear of hurting feelings or the employee responding negatively
Diagnosing the root cause of a failure to give feedback is the first step. If clarity is the issue, how can you get more insight into the individual employees work and performance? If its competence thats holding you back, where can you find best practices for initiating a conversation around feedback? If courage is the issue, who can you talk to that can encourage and hold you accountable? At the end of the day, receiving constructive feedback is foundational to an employees growth. Someone cant improve what theyre not aware of, so failing to provide this insight will do more harm than good in the long run.
Mistake #2: Failing to connect an employees day-to-day work to the organizations mission. 
We all want to know our work mattersand be part of something bigger than ourselves. But almost half of employees (45 percent) reported feeling more disconnected from their organizations mission since going remote. People who find meaning in their work are more likely to perform at a high level and are more engaged. So knowing that people feel detached from the organizations mission, consider implementing a cadence of communication that helps employees see that their work matters beyond meeting deadlines or ticking off boxes on their to-do lists. Additionally, when you celebrate wins, be intentional about sharing the ripple effect of the achievement. For example, lets say youre the leader of an event-planning agency (which, no doubt, has been impacted by the pandemic) and youve just pulled off a successful virtual industry conference. Instead of simply congratulating your employees on a job well done, talk about the number of attendees who learned something that will help them excel in a job theyre passionate about. If youre a sales leader at a project management software company, estimate and celebrate the number of hours youll save the new customer your team just sold. Sometimes all it takes is a little perspective to help employees see that their work matters.
Mistake #3: Not prioritizing professional development for their people. 
Emplifys survey revealed that 47 percent of respondents have had fewer professional development opportunities while working remotely. Since lack of growth opportunities are among the top reasons people leave companies, managers should take this seriously. But before prescribing a course or program, start having conversations with people to set goals for their growth. If an individual contributor is eyeing a promotion to a manager, help her identify the skills shell need to be a people leader before setting her up with a manager development course. Another approach a manager could take is simply acting as the gatekeeper for company time and resources. You could require each of your direct reports to identify a growth area or set a goal, and then give them the autonomy to chart their own course. If you go this route, just make sure to build in some accountability into the process. 
Leading well is difficult in the best of times, never mind during a pandemic. Leveling up your remote leadership skills will take patience and persistence. But as more and more organizations begin hiring remote workers outside of their locality, excellent remote managers will be rewarded with engaged and high-performing teams.

200,kj@mentedcosmetics.com,"For Savage x Fenty, Rihanna's lingerie and beauty brand, diversity and inclusion are in the brand's DNA.
""There's no other way that our brand could be,"" Christiane Pendarvis, the company's copresident and chief merchandising and design officer, said during a panel discussion at this year's virtual NRF Chapter One conference this week.
With a variety of plus-size lingerie options and a vast spectrum of ""nude"" apparel shades for different skin tones, Savage x Fenty is known for its focus on inclusivity. The company regularly features a cast of diverse models in its annually streamed fashion show, and was recently named one of the 15 fastest-growing online beauty brands during the pandemic, according to data from SimilarWeb, which provides global digital traffic insights about websites and apps.
Pendarvis outlined steps on Tuesday for different companies to address racism, inclusion, and diversity. While she acknowledged that diversity is a natural cornerstone of Savage x Fenty as a Black-owned beauty and apparel business, she said other brands can do work towards empowering minorities and promoting diversity.
""The reality is, it is a business problem,"" Pendarvis said, regarding diversity and inclusion. ""And I think you have to tackle it in the same way you tackle any serious business problem.""

To start, Pendarvis recommends that companies look at their data for minority representation across leadership and mid-level roles to understand how this can impact advancement opportunities and employee retention. She explained how important it is to have an ""honest conversation"" about the company's current position in order to be able to grow.
To further address issues of racism, Savage x Fenty holds group sessions called ""courageous conversations"" for employees of color to share personal stories of racism and prejudice. Programs like these, Pendarvis said, ""crystallize"" what racism looks like to different people and helps bring professionals together to find a solution.
""I think  It's also incumbent upon those of us to share those personal stories, particularly with people that you've worked for, because it brings it home in a real way,"" she said.
The company's annually streamed fashion show also regularly features a cast of diverse models.
Savage x Fenty Show Vol 2./Amazon Prime
On the consumer side, Pendarvis emphasized the importance of fully understanding a brand's role in the marketplace and among consumers. For example, while the beauty industry has historically struggled with representing diverse skin types and body figures, brands like Mented Cosmetics and Fenty Beauty are appealing to a wider consumer base looking for a more diverse array of products.
""It really turned his head on the cosmetics industry and it shouldn't have taken that long,"" Pendarvis said about Fenty Beauty launching a line of 40 shades of foundation in 2017. ""When you just look at the diversity of customers and women that were buying beauty products, that shouldn't have been as breakthrough as it was. But I think if beauty brands had really been talking to women of color, they would have found that we were wholly unsatisfied with what the options are.""
While listening to the consumer is important from a business perspective, it is also crucial to Savage x Fenty's goal to empower diverse voices. This represents one of the more meaningful elements of Pendarvis' role within the company.
""For, me, this role with Savage I think has given me an amazing platform to make sure that all customers, all women in particular, are represented in the fashion and beauty world,"" she said.","According to data from SimilarWeb, Savage x Fenty was named one of the 15 fastest-growing online beauty brands during the pandemic. What elements would you attribute to your success during such a challenging market?",
199,kj@mentedcosmetics.com,"With $4 billion in sales in 12 months and a rosy forecast ahead, lipstick manufacturers were smiling at the end of 2019, and the ""lipstick index"" — traditionally a shorthand measure of consumer spending — looked healthy. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, bringing face masks and an unstable economy. With no end to the crisis in sight, brands large and small have had to adjust manufacturing, advertising, and social media on the fly. The results, they say, are paying off — and may mark the beginning of profound changes for the cosmetics industry.
Beyond changes in everyday demand for lip color, some businesses have found themselves re-examining everything from their supply chain up. E.L.F. Beauty, a mass-market brand founded in 2004, reacted to the pandemic earlier than most, according to Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer, because it sources its products abroad. It made changes in early January — weeks before Western countries entered lockdown — when its operation in China was impacted. It has managed to adjust and keep customers supplied, but has noticed a shift in what people are buying. 
Lipstick has slid, most likely because people cared less about the colors of their lips when they're all having to wear masks and the economic fallout of lockdown, but sales of other items rose to pick up the slack.
""We saw a surge in the market around bronzer and brow, so we swiftly deployed assets and messaging to accelerate E.L.F. bronzers and brow products,"" Marchisotto says. ""As we continue navigating through COVID-19, we closely monitor consumer signals and learn that they don't just change monthly or weekly during this crisis. They can change daily or even hourly.""
These shifts are happening across the industry. A May report from McKinsey, the consultancy giant, found cosmetics sales had dropped 55% among prestige brands. ""When consumers do return to work, many will continue to wear masks, further slowing makeup's recovery,"" the report said. However, the report noted that sales of skin-, nail- and hair-care products in Europe had quadrupled, as more people pampered themselves at home — and a September report from market research firm NPD found that more women in the US were using facial skincare products than in 2019.
This constant adjustment has been particularly challenging for independent brands, which may not have the cash or infrastructure to absorb huge drops in sales or swings in their inventory. For Mented, a growing, Black-owned brand with a dedicated following for its highly-pigmented color cosmetics, the pandemic has proved challenging — but surprising, in a good way.
Cofounder Amanda E. Johnson says: ""We were planning on having a great 2020 and then March hit. It was slow in the beginning for everybody, because COVID shook the world and no one knew what was going on. So, we thought, 'oh, we're going to have a horrible year like everyone else.'""
The company adjusted its forecast down 40% and braced for disaster, but was shocked when April's sales figures came in. ""We were like, ""Oh my God, this is the biggest month in the history of the company. It must be an anomaly."" It wasn't. Sales are actually trending up and projections have been readjusted.
Amanda E. Johnson, cofounder and COO of Mented Cosmetics.
Mented Cosmetics
Johnson says the fact the business has always been online only helped — as did its focus on people of color. She also believes that lipstick, despite rising mask-wearing, is finding its place in the pandemic with two very different kinds of consumers. ""One, there's the professional that's working from home. So, if she is working from home, she's on Zoom and Team and Google Hangout calls all day long"" and secondly, ""the essential worker. So, we've asked, why are you still putting on lipstick every day? And what we've heard back is, because 'I need something to make me feel good right now.'""
Marchisotto agrees, predicting the business will keep promoting beauty as an important element of self-care in a difficult time. One nurse wrote to the company saying its primer had changed her life — this kind of direct feedback is important at a time when all historical models of trends are obsolete. ""It was another moment for us to understand the power of our products. We don't just sell beauty."" 
While the path forward is still unclear, Johnson is beginning to think that marketing products as an indulgence could prove successful. ""Women are definitely still buying makeup in droves,"" she says, but adds that the difference is ""they want brands to tell them that they're doing the right thing.""
It remains to be seen which platforms are best for telling buyers that. TikTok, Home Shopping Network, and Instagram have all shown good results for these brands. The message is clearly one consumers want to hear. ""Historically, color cosmetics has been a 'recession-proof product,'"" Johnson said. ""And I think what we're seeing is, in some ways, it is also pandemic proof.""",,

75,theresa@zylo.com,"Theresa!?!Zylo!?!We know that a lot of elements go into the formation of a startup ecosystem. When your city is outside of the major coastal tech centers, it takes a deliberate effort to get such a system off the ground. For Indianapolis, Indiana, it started with the creation of ExactTarget in 2000. When that company was sold to Salesforce for $2.5 billion in 2013, it helped bring a bushel of cash into the startup system.
Today, the venture capital firm that connects back to that ExactTarget acquisition, High Alpha Capital, announced a new $110 million fund. The company concentrates on B2B SaaS startups. Kristian Andersen, partner and co-founder at High Alpha sees the fund in the context of the pandemic and the changes it has brought to how businesses are run.
“We are living in a [time] of almost unrivaled disruption, which has created a host of challenges for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. In spite (or possibly because) of those challenges, we’re more confident and motivated than ever to help support the next generation of founders as they seek to transform the world through the marriage of entrepreneurship and technology,” Anderson said.
Of course, cash is a key ingredient in any startup system recipe. ExactTarget’s founders were flush with it after the acquisition and Scott Dorsey, one of the firm’s founders says they wanted to build a system from the ground up that included education, a system to encourage entrepreneurship, math skills, a pool of engineering talent and of course, a venture capital firm to drive investment.
“I think of the recipe as talent, capital, support and mentorship. So talent has to be a sharp focus, which is certainly is for us at High Alpha and across the Indianapolis market. The second piece is capital, and markets like Indy often don’t have access to capital and that’s been important that we’re raising our own funds,” he said.
He added, “Thirdly, I think  It's just support and mentorship and that’s really what High Alpha is built to do. We have 40 of us on the team with SaaS experts across design, marketing, product engineering, finance and HR —  all Centers of Excellence you need to start and scale a SaaS company,” he said.
The firm is divided into two parts. The first is High Alpha Studio, which is a kind of incubator for really early stage founders and the second is High Alpha Capital, which is the focus of today’s announcement.
This is third fund for the company. The first was High Alpha One worth $21 million. The second one, High Alpha Two was worth $85 million. Combined with today’s announcement, the total raised across the three funds is $216 million. While the first two funds’ investments were mostly in the Indy area, the plan with the newest one is to expand beyond the region with at least some of the investments.
The firm concentrates on enterprise B2B SaaS companies from pre-seed through Series A investments, so concentrating on early stage companies that it can help nurture and learn from their experiences building ExactTarget into a successful company.
Among the companies they invested in include Attentive, SalesLoft, Zylo, Terminus, The Mom Project, Lessonly, LogicGate, MetaCX and Socio.",It's great to see High Alpha Capital announce the launch of a new $110 million fund.

71,justin.shriber@people.ai,"Justin!?!People.ai!?!From each of our twoexperiences starting out as introductory-level engineers at Box, to becoming first-time managers overseeing five-person teams, then directors overseeing 30-50, and ultimately VPs managing hundreds, we've experienced software engineering from every angle.
At every step of the way, we asked ourselves: ""how do we know if we are bringing value as engineering leaders?"" Effective leadership uniquely blends human qualities - influence, empathy, courage, and results. This latter quality always brings the question of productivity - how effective are you at producing results through enabling others?
Since the advent of the software industry, most engineering teams have seen productivity as a black box. Only recently have people even begun to build internal tools that optimize performance. Unfortunately, most of these tools measure the wrong metrics and are shockingly similar across companies. We even built some of these tools and made mistakes. Now, we'd like to share the way forward. 
Engineering Effectiveness is Behind the Times 
Engineering teams are both the most expensive and most fundamental part of tech companies. As more companies become tech-enabled, the importance of engineering will only increase. Yet today, a full three decades after the advent of the internet, most engineering departments still rely exclusively on qualitative signals of performance.
The evolution of engineering effectiveness is paralleling the spirit of sales' recent transformation. In the early 2000s, sales was considered an art, so sales leaders could skate by on charisma alone. Today, with tools like Salesforce, Clari, and People.ai, sales has fully executed the transition toward scientific, metric-based leadership for analyzing and improving performance.
In the coming years, engineering will adopt a similar, data-driven mode of management. In making this transition, however, most engineering teams are making these mistakes:
Mistake #1: Measuring Approximations of Output
In their haste to become more data-driven, many engineering leaders are measuring their team's performance based on metrics intended to approximate output. These metrics fail because they encourage engineers to game the system.
If you measure a fixed metric like lines of code or number of tickets closed, your engineers will begin splitting code into more lines or breaking bug fixes into multiple tickets. Even sprint points, which attempt to convert engineering work into a standard unit, suffer from this pitfall: Some engineers will slow down after reaching their sprint points for the week while others will strategically inflate their tasks to be awarded additional points.
Experienced engineers will recognize that this type of measurement is fake. While they may not be as influenced to ""play the game,"" their morale will plummet and they will self-select out. By rewarding approximated metrics of output, you're encouraging engineers to increase them regardless of how they correlate with software development success.
No matter which metrics you choose, abstract output approximations will distract engineers from their actual jobs, ultimately decreasing both your team's effectiveness and morale.
Mistake #2: Not Measuring Anything
On the other end of the spectrum sit engineering leaders who avoid measurement entirely. Many of these leaders have heard about the dangers of measuring the wrong metrics and therefore ricochet to the other extreme. They may emphasize the artisanal and social dimensions of engineering, claiming ""software engineering is too complex to measure.""
Non-measurement can even be self-reinforcing, because it places the leader into the position of being ""the good guy."" Instead of being a metrics-obsessed big brother, the leader can be the friendly older brother exclusively focused on keeping their team happy.
Non-measurement fails because it prioritizes politics over productivity. If you don't measure any metrics, your engineering leaders will simply justify failures, telling stories like ""The customer didn't give us the right requirements"" or ""We were surprised by unexpected vacations."" Software development is complex enough that something always goes wrong; if you don't measure any data, you're at the mercy of individual stories.
Non-measurement unfairly rewards people with charisma while productive but less-persuasive engineers wallow in frustration.
At some point, your top performers will see through these political machinations and quit because your culture lacks accountability.
In the short term, non-measurement can have a positive effect on team morale but it destroys morale in the long-term, especially among high performers. 
The Solution: Measure Blockers at the Team Level 
Instead of measuring some approximation of engineering output, software teams should measure actual, observable metrics that directly correlate to effectiveness.
Productivity is a relationship between inputs and output. In software development, the inputs are a blend of factors--technical, individual, human, etc.--while the output should be functional software that creates value for customers. Productivity in engineering therefore naturally increases when you remove the blockers getting in the way of your team.
Why You Should Measure Blockers
Even at the beginning of the software revolution, there existed the notion that engineers should be nurtured. Starting with Microsoft in the '80s, tech companies gave engineers free resources (like food and gyms) that would remove blockers to their work. Empirical management practices over the last forty years have reinforced the importance of ""servant leadership"" and ""unblocking your team,"" while recent research emphasizes the importance of optimized inputs and best practices.
For engineers, these inputs include:
<ul><li>Quality of developer tools</li><li>Frequency and quality of internal activities (like meetings or code reviews) </li><li>Focused maker time (free from disruptive meetings)</li><li>Easy access to documentation</li><li>Psychological safety on the team</li><li>Work-life balance</li><li>Presence of other high-performers </li><li>A fair system of rewards</li></ul>The blockers to these inputs already exist and can be quantified, such as:
<ul><li>How much free, uninterrupted time does an engineer have to code?</li><li>How long is an engineer waiting on a response from another engineer's review?</li><li>How often do dev tools get in the way instead of helping accelerate work? </li><li>How often are engineers required to context switch, preventing deep work?</li><li>How often do engineers receive pages outside of business hours, interrupting their sleep or family life?</li></ul>An engineering leader exists to enable their team to achieve their goals. Together, these quantified blockers allow engineering leaders to answer key questions like:
<ul><li>What is preventing the engineers from building faster?</li><li>What issues are arising in real time?  </li><li>What technology or process investments would increase team engagement?</li></ul>Each engineering team is unique, so its blockers will be specific.  It's not so simple as ""more maker time is better."" If your engineering team is new or temporarily misaligned on key goals, more meeting time might be the answer. What never changes is the need for measurement and well-considered, deliberate decisions.
Over the last year, COVID-19 has helped demonstrate the value of measuring blockers. For many leaders running newly remote teams, new blockers have arisen that would never have been noticed if managers were only focusing on the desired outcome.
If your team is full of competent, driven engineers, removing their blockers is the fastest way to enable forward movement.
Why ""Team"" is the Right Level to Improve
Since software development requires complex interaction between team members, it would be inappropriate to assign individuals their own metrics: Some engineers are effective individual contributors while others enable their teammates to perform. Engineers also hate being micromanaged, so tracking individual activity can make them feel untrusted.
Just as a sports team wins or loses together, so too should the engineering team be treated as the fundamental unit of success.
Approaching engineering at the team level also places the proper accountability on the manager. It raises helpful questions like ""What behaviors, structures, and work habits are preventing us from succeeding?""
Looking at the team level also enables managers to catch blockers as they evolve. Small issues, for instance, may not be apparent when the company is young, but can evolve into 10,000 papercuts only apparent at the team level. If code reviews take days instead of hours, at first one engineer complains, then two, then three... and if you don't pay attention, years later the engineering culture is shot. By compiling these small quantifications and observing their trends, a manager can understand whether a report is one individual's experience or truly relevant to the overall performance of the team.
Perhaps most important, if blockers follow a constant evolution (e.g. one person is often the canary in the coalmine), an engineering leader can map how the new blockers are likely to evolve and prioritize which should be solved first.
Just as an airplane pilot must monitor dozens of different metrics to keep the plane flying, so too would an engineering leader benefit from viewing their team's metrics to understand overall performance.
In an optimal engineering dashboard, a leader would be able to assess the blockers that prevent the ultimate success of their team. 
Toward Engineering Effectiveness 
""Productivity"" is an appropriate measure for someone making widgets at a factory: ""How many products did you produce in an hour?""
Engineering should instead be about effectiveness: ""How able is this engineer to effect positive impact?""
Looking forward, engineering effectiveness will have three parts:
<ol><li>Measuring the experience of engineering teams in their most frequent activities. (Think distributed tracing, but for human activities.)</li><li>Using the results of those measurements to quantitatively improve the developer experience.</li><li>The final result will take care of itself. (As Jeff Bezos or legendary football coach Bill Walsh would agree, through a better usage of inputs, the output will improve.)</li></ol>If you're an engineering leader, here are a few tips to get started right away: 
<ol><li>Look at your team's calendars:<ul><li>Do people have enough blocks of uninterrupted time to execute complex and intellectually rewarding tasks?</li><li>How much of the meeting load was created by you, the engineering leader?</li><li>Are there recurring meetings that could be done asynchronously?</li><li>Are the same people always asked to perform all the interviews?</li></ul></li><li>Check your team's Git logs:<ul><li>Are most code reviews taking less than a day or can you find very long or even stale code reviews?</li><li>Are remote parts of the team getting the same review treatment or do they have to wait longer than their local counterparts?</li><li>Are people adjusting to long review cycles by opening many tracks of work at once (which is bad for focus)?</li></ul></li><li>Survey your team:<ul><li>Are they happy with the tooling or is it getting in their way?</li><li>How do they feel about pages and alerting? Is it affecting their personal lives?</li></ul></li><li>Finally, turn all these questions into metrics.<ul><li>Pick goals and commit to improving the most urgent blockers.</li><li>Share the dashboard of these metrics with the team.</li></ul></li></ol>In all these cases, the right solution will be up to the manager. For example, if meetings are the issue, perhaps they should be later in the day, more clumped together, or eliminated altogether: once you've found the blocker,  It's the manager's job to improve.
By quantifying blockers and focusing on the team, engineering leaders can transform their department into a data-driven practice that enables everyone's success.
Engineers will become more focused and engaged, managers will become more effective and empathetic, and companies will build faster with higher quality. Engineering will rise to a whole new level.",How do you feel about the current culture of software engineering?

69,omri@routable.com,"Omri!?!Routable!?!Hey HN! Im Omri and I co-founded Routable (https://routable.com) with Tom Harel. We are a business payments platform built to make bill payments and mass payouts fast and seamless, especially as your company scales. We were in YC's S17 batch, but are doing a Launch HN now because we recently completed a huge integration with NetSuite, which will help larger enterprises automate their business payment workflows.Tom and I started working on Routable in early 2017. The idea was sparked while we were eating hummus in Tel Aviv. When we first met up, we had no intention of spending years of our lives trying to figure out how to make bill payments and invoicing easier. But we realized after a three hour conversation that at our two different marketplace companies we had both spent 40% of our engineering resources on building internal tooling to pay out sellers, drivers, restaurants, etc.
After we realized we'd experienced the same pain at different startups, we asked ourselves, what did we do wrong? Was there a solution that worked across finance, engineering, and operations that we were simply not aware of? To find out, we interviewed over 300 people - CFOs, VPs of Finance, Heads of Engineering, you name it - to understand how businesses scaled their business payouts and invoicing (think: growing from 1,000 payments per month to 400,000+ payments per month).
The two main answers we received were: (a) Like us, they'd spent thousands of hours and engineering dollars to build an in-house internal tool, on top of processors, and wrote their own custom integration to an ERP; or (b) they hired an army of overqualified individuals to run daily data entry across thousands of bill payments and invoices (which was tedious, not to mention very expensive).
These conversations confirmed what we had suspected: There was no tool for easy payments that worked across multiple departments. We realized that what we had built at our marketplace start-ups could potentially help hundreds of other companies. In 6 weeks we spun up a Routable MVP and were making money for customers. Today, we're deployed across some of the largest marketplaces and gig economy companies. Weve focused on working with engineering and finance departments as much as possible to save them from building custom in-house solutions.
Our recent integration with NetSuite has been by far the hardest weve done especially since we built it on top of a SOAP API and extended native functionality with SuiteScript but it was worth it, because we gained a deep appreciation for how complex enterprise business payment operations can be. To make sure we got it right, we again did plenty of customer development interviews to best understand what data needs to go into and out of NetSuite, and made sure to record each interview so we could share their unique pain points with our engineering team.
Before we wrote the first line of code, we interviewed a bunch of NetSuite users and learned what was lacking in other NetSuite integrations out there: tools that only synced in one direction, needing to recreate fields multiple in different platforms, processes that were breaking because the workflow had changed in your ERP, but not in your AP software. The one thing we learned throughout this whole process is that once you build an integration to an ERP, youre never really done, so we expect as a team to forever tinker on sending data back and forth with the goal of continuously improving our integration and hopefully saving our customers 30 seconds to 10 minutes of work at a time.

68,matt@logrocket.com,"Matthew!?!LogRocket!?!In an unprecedented year that saw many teams shift to remote working, we asked tech and business leaders to pick their essential tools.
Throughout our Leaders Insights series on Siliconrepublic.com last year, we asked a host of tech and business leaders from Ireland and further afield to name the essential tools and resources that get them through the working week.
In a year that brought major disruption to most of our working lives, they turned to video conferencing, collaboration software and a whole lot of coffee.
Handy hardware
The move away from offices means many of us are now relying on tech devices for both work and keeping in touch. Seán Keating of Vilicom said his number-one tool is his smartphone. Its like the Swiss army knife of business tools. It keeps me on schedule, navigates to meetings, runs all our most important business apps, connects my laptop to our IT cloud, enables our Teams communications and more.
HPs Gary Tierney said that his phone and laptop are the must-have items for work, but since the arrival of Covid-19 he has been relying more on his laptop. Ive found that working from home has put an even greater emphasis on the criticality of my PC as a communication tool and a general workhorse.
Many people also had to figure out a new at-home work set-up last year. I recently invested in a 38-inch ultra-wide monitor and its been a game changer for me, Joe Lennon of Workvivo told us over the summer.
Video conferencing
2020 was the year we all became very familiar with Zoom (as well as Zoombombing and Zoom fatigue).
Amy Bunszel of Autodesk said she now spends most of her day on Zoom, and Patrick Horgan of Horizon8 said tools such as Zoom are proving incredibly helpful in the work-from-home dynamic.
But there are plenty of other alternatives out there. Microsoft Teams was highlighted as an essential daily tool by plenty of people, including SL Controls Keith Moran, CWSIs Ronan Murphy and Avanades Graham Healy.
Martin McKay of Texthelp said he couldnt be without the Google Meet and Chat tools at the moment, and Xilinxs Brendan Farley said Skype and Webex are other options being used for video calls.
Online collaboration tools are integral to not just our success but our basic functioning, added Ogie Sheehy of ViClarity. Whether it is Zoom or GoToMeeting, Google Chat or Microsoft Teams, these tools are enabling us to continue to work uninterrupted across a global footprint. 
Software saviours
While Microsoft Teams has seen a sharp rise in users in the past year, many companies have been relying on other products from the Microsoft 365 stack. Ronan Murphy of CWSI said these tools allow his company to do whatever we need to do from wherever we are.
SoftwareOnes Una Keeshan said she uses the focus plan in Microsoft MyAnalytics to set aside time for priority work, while Avanades Graham Healy said he uses Microsoft Dynamics for customer relationship management and Power BI for reporting, forecasting and analytics.
With teams dispersed, messaging and collaboration tools such as Slack also came to the fore. Its a convenient way to collaborate over projects and to organise ourselves according to different topics and business functions, said Oz Alashe of CybSafe.
Collaboration tools have always been important for developers. Joe Lennon of Workvivo said GitHub is fundamental for his engineering team to manage source code and code reviews, and they regularly use Tuple to do remote pair programming.
Jennifer Sethre of Intry said Intercom and LogRocket are important tools for her HR tech company, and Keith Moran of SL Controls turns to the Frankli platform for engaging with his team.
Lettertecs Frank Kelly uses Google Keep for jotting quick notes down as they occur, while ViClaritys Ogie Sheehy is a fan of the voice dictation app on his iPhone. It allows me to be immediately responsive to important emails that come through when I am out and about and away from my desk, he said.
A good old-fashioned to-do list
While there may be a fancy tech tool for everything, many leaders still rely on a simple to-do list to keep focused. Nessa McEniff of Learnovate said listing her priorities is a key part of the week and shes a bit of an obsessive list maker.
Netssos Brian ODoherty added that a having a clear list keeps him grounded. I set myself a weekly list and find that its a great way of keeping the faith in myself, my work and my ambitions, he said.
But Liz Cunningham of Google said she is still looking for the perfect tool that will manage all her to-do lists across personal and work life to help keep all the balls in the air.
PayPals Annette Hickey noted that her calendar helps keep her focused throughout the week, and Dells Jason Ward said an organised calendar is key to ensuring I am as productive as possible.
Keeping the mind clear
The sudden shift to remote working means that many have had to find new ways to focus, while still maintaining a good work-life balance and not overworking now that your kitchen may be your office.
To help with this, Nicole Sahin of Globalization Partners said she keeps Fridays free of Zoom meetings. Its like heaven to have that time to think and get things done.
Similarly, Codemas Donna Gartland said that, since the shift to working from home, she now blocks time in her calendar each week without meetings to focus and get deep work done. I use distraction blockers across all my devices, she added, such as Stay Focusd on my browser and Focus mode on Pixel.
Xilinxs Brendan Farley said he removed the work email app from his phone many years ago, which helps him switch off in the evenings. And Mark Cockerill of ServiceNow suggested having a great Spotify playlist on hand.
Getting away from the desk
For minding mental and physical health, many other leaders also suggested getting out and about. SL Controls Keith Moran enjoys a good game of squash in the evening, Arkphires Paul Nannetti tries to run on the beach a few times a week, and Fenergos Louise OConnell said that yoga or a walk in the fresh air can help to just clear the mind.
Una Keeshan of SoftwareOne has recently taken tennis back up as a hobby. The tennis is not only great exercise, she said, but also helps me clear my head from work or the stresses of the day.
And Autodesks Amy Bunszel said that, now she doesnt have a commute for the time being, its a bit easier to make time for exercise every morning and a nice dinner in the evening.
Food certainly plays a key part in the day for many. Horizon8s Patrick Horgan said the barbecue has proved an essential tool for bringing his family together in the current environment.
And one of the essential tools to get Dells Jason Ward through the week? Coffee, coffee and more coffee.",I see that your list of essential tools that you use every day for your company is going to be a great read for many people this year.

67,sam@madkudu.com,"Sam!?!MadKudu!?!Responding quickly to incoming leads can make or break a deal, particularly in highly competitive markets. The more mature a business gets, and the more complex the prospective customers needs are, the more challenging it is to maintain that speedy response and personalized touch.
Quickly growing businesses require more sophisticated automation to ensure operational efficiency, proper distribution of leads among their sales team, and to make sure no leads slip through cracks.
Thats what makes lead routing a critical component to any scaling sales strategy.
At its most fundamental, lead routing is the process of automatically assigning leads across a sales team, or through the proper sales model if your company has more than one sales approach, like self-serve, transactional, and enterprise.
Automated lead routing can be simple, such as a round-robin assignment to your sales reps based on who is next in line. Mature lead routing models take multiple factors into account, like deal value, territory or geography, use case or specialization, or a combination of multiple factors by alead scoring system.
Unless youre in a highly niche industry, chances are your business attracts more than one type of customer. Lead routing helps make sure the right prospects reach the right people, and at the right time, saving your business time and resources.
Lead Routing by Value
Companies like Slack and Dropbox popularize the hybrid approach ofbuilding a self-serve business in tandem with an enterprise one. This approach maximizes operational efficiency by keeping the most expensive resource - the sales reps time - focused on building relationships and closing larger deals while routing smaller deals to a low-touch, high volume, one-to-many sales model.
Tools likeClearbit can help pull in data about customers company size and value to pre-populate CRM data. Using this data, low-value leads can be handled by self-serve marketing automation (with a human touch provided by customer support teams answering incoming questions). High-value leads can be sent directly to sales teams to guide high value, complex deals through an enterprise sales process.
Lead Routing by Territory or Geography
For industries tied to brick-and-mortar stores or geographical locations, like manufacturing or real estate, defining territories is a common practice. Leads are assigned by location, enabling sales teams to divide and conquer regionally. Routing leads by geography provides certainty that reps arent stepping on each others toes with double coverage in some areas, while completely neglecting others.
For lead routing by territory to work, you must first define your territories and organize your CRM data around those definitions. With the right CRM and automated toolset, you can sort records into territories and assign leads to any reps working within that territory using round-robin automation.
Lead Routing by Use Case or Specialization
Many tools and systems, especially in SaaS, have multiple relevant use cases. A tool like HubSpot, for example, serves customer service teams, sales teams, and marketing teams, which all come with their own buyer personas, choosers, users, and influencers. Flexible tools like Trello might be used for anything from wedding planning to software bug triage.
Savvy sales teams know that industry expertise helps establish the trusted advisor relationship requisite to closing the big deals, which makes lead routing by specialization or use case increasingly important for enterprise sales models.
Lets take an example of software targeted to creative firms, encompassing graphic design, animation, film editing, and illustration. Its unlikely all sales reps will develop the expertise needed to speak to the needs of all of those varied professionals, even if they do sit under a similar umbrella.
Instead, you may have your top sales reps cover the largest deals that involve multiple products across a company, but route smaller, more specialized deals to reps who specialize in a particular area. Reps that specialize in the graphic design product can handle all deals that come in with that interest as an entry point, whereas those who specialize in the animation product speak to the animation firms who are interested.
Lead Routing by Lead Score
The most sophisticated sales models implementlead scoring as part of their lead routing process. Lead scoring assigns a quantifiable value to every lead generated for the business, usually by a numerical point system.
Leads can be scored on multiple attributes, including a combination of previously mentioned qualities such as value, geography, and use case, but also on qualities like engagement with your company and brand to assess the strength of the leads likelihood to close.
Lead scoring helps sales teams prioritize leads, and apply a more tailored approach to engagement, thereby closing more leads with less effort. Lead scoring can also help define whether a lead needsmore time being nurtured, could close with a low-touch one-to-many approach, or requires the high-touch consultative efforts of a dedicated sales rep.
Route only those with scores ready for sales to your sales team to not only maximize time and efforts. This results in a happy and productive sales team by minimizing the frustration of poor leads.
How to Get Started
Getting started with lead routing is simpleif you have the right tools, including a CRM with automation capabilities and a tool for lead scoring such as HubSpot partner MadKudu.
To develop lead rotation, you will need to:
<ol><li>Define your lead routing criteria, like value, use case, territory, or lead score</li><li>Create workflows or automations based on that criteria</li><li>Qualify leads, which can also be done with lead scoring, and rotate between your reps</li></ol>Setting up the automation with the proper toolset is easy, but theres more to setting lead routing on autopilot when it comes to building a successful sales strategy.
In order to improve and optimize your lead routing, you need to know whats working and whats not. Monitor and report on the successes or shortcomings of routing by certain criteria to understand why routing and segmenting by some criteria work better than others for your sales team, customers, and product. Automated lead routing makes it easy to experiment and shift gears, so you can zero in on the most effective approach for your business.

How to Find The Best Dispatch Software For You
When youre trying to manage field employees successfully, you want to approach scheduling and dispatching with an operating system that will ultimately increase productivity for everyone involved. While most dispatch software can take care of the basics like scheduling and customer support, there are a few key features you want to look for when choosing the best one for your business.
GPS Tracking
Real-time routing ensures you always know the location of each employee on the field. This ensures coordination of breaks, canceled or late appointments, rescheduling, and adjustments to ETAs.
If youre a dispatcher managing both technicians and company service vehicles, then a sturdy GPS tracking system allowing you to track vehicle locations in real-time can be a huge time-saver for your business.
Some dispatch software also provides historical vehicle tracking if you need to reference it in the future. Some can go as far as tracking gas usage per vehicle, unauthorized usage, and even alerts dispatchers if a technician is speeding or being unsafe on the road.
Accounting Capabilities
While dispatch software helps you optimize the management of your technicians, some can fall short in the accounting and billing department. With third-party integrations, you can connect software like Quickbooks to ensure your numbers and estimates are accurate.
Other dispatch software isnt as flexible and only lets you use the built-in accounting software, which can be basic depending on what you need it for. If integrated accounting is a big part of how you manage field service scheduling, youll want to find software with either the ability to integrate with third-party software or which has a built-in accounting system that goes beyond basic billing.
Automated Customer Notifications
In the field service business, keeping your customers happy means repeat business, better word of mouth, and business growth. But this cant happen if you arent connecting with your customers in a way thats convenient for them.
With service-based businesses, anything could happen in the process of getting one technician from point A to point B. Automated ETA notifications help you manage customer expectations if technicians run into trouble, need to stay at one location longer, or need to be replaced with a new technician. To manage customer relationships and expectations, look for software that enables you to easily communicate with them through instant text, automated emails, or phone calls.
Wrapping It All Up
Whats the best dispatch software for your business? That answer can change depending on the features your business needs and how large an operation you manage on a daily basis. To recap, here are our top five options:
Whether youre a small business dispatching a few technicians a day or managing an enterprise fleet, you can definitely find the best solution for your business with this guide.","I saw that ServiceTitan is a top-rated field service platform with more than 100,000 users.

59,uri@toriihq.com,"Uri!?!Torii!?!Today, that software is offered as a cloud service should be pretty much considered a given. Certainly any modern tooling is going to be SaaS, and as companies and employees add services, it becomes a management nightmare. Enter Torii, an early stage startup that wants to make it easier to manage SaaS bloat.
Today, the company announced a $10 million Series A investment led by Wing Venture Capital with participation from prior investors Entree Capital, Global Founders Capital, Scopus Ventures and Uncork Capital. The investment brings the total raised to $15 million, according to the company. Under the terms of the deal, Wing partner Jake Flomenberg is joining the board.
Uri Haramati, co-founder and CEO, is a serial entrepreneur who helped launch Houseparty and Meerkat. As a serial founder, he says that he and his co-founders saw first-hand how difficult it was to manage their companies’ SaaS applications and the idea for Torii developed from that.
“We all felt the changes around SaaS and managing the tools that we were using. We were all early adopters of SaaS. We all [took advantage of SaaS] to scale our companies and we felt the same thing: The fact is that you just can’t add more people who manage more software, it just doesn’t scale,” Haramati told me.
He said they started Torii with the idea of using software to control the SaaS sprawl they were experiencing. At the heart of the idea was an automation engine to discover and manage all of the SaaS tools inside an organization. Once you know what you have, there is a no-code workflow engine to create workflows around those tools for key activities like onboarding or offboarding employees.
Torii Workflow Engine. Image Credits: Torii
The approach seems to be working. As the pandemic struck in 2020, more companies than ever needed to control and understand the SaaS tooling they had, and revenue grew 400% YoY last year. Customers include Delivery Hero, Chewy, Monday.com and Palo Alto Networks.
The company also doubled its employees from a dozen they started last year with with plans to get to 60 people by the end of this year. As they do that, as experienced entrepreneurs Haramati told me they already understood the value of developing a diverse and inclusive workforce, certainly around gender. Today, the team is 25 people with 10 being women and they are working to improve those ratios as they continue to add new people.
Flomenberg invested in Torii because he was particularly impressed with the automation aspect of the company and how it took a holistic approach to the SaaS management problem, rather than attempting to solve one part of it. “When I met Uri, he described this vision. It was really to become the operating system for SaaS. It all starts with the right data. You can trust data that is gathered from [multiple] sources to really build the right picture and pull it together. And then they took all those signals and they built a platform that is built on automation,” he said.
Haramati admits that  It's challenging to scale in the midst of a pandemic, but the company is growing and is already working to expand the platform to include product recommendations and help with compliance and cost control.","I saw Torii announce a $10 million Series A investment led by Wing Venture Capital with participation from prior investors Entree Capital, Global Founders Capital, Scopus Ventures and Uncork Capital. The investment brings the total raised to $15 million, according to the company, and  It's growing fast.",
58,kurt@emplify.com,"Kurt!?!Emplify!?!Leaders need to double-down on feedback, growth, and mission with remote workers.
SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images
2020 has marked the start of a new era of leadership in many companies. While the hallmarks of good leadershiplike empathy and emotional intelligencetranscend the boundaries of physical offices, leading well remotely has a different set of challenges than leading well in-person. Have newly remote leaders risen to the occasion? To answer this question, Emplify recently surveyed one thousand employees that have only been working remotely full-time since the start of the pandemic.
First, the good news. Half of survey respondents said that their managers level of trust in them has increased since working remotely, and 88 percent shared that their relationship with their manager has either stayed the same or improved. It seems that leaders are also learning to flex their empathy muscles, as 74 percent believe that their manager cares about their mental and emotional well-being. 
But the survey also reveals that remote leaders need to level up in several critical areas. While fewer people are open to new job opportunities than this time in 2019, 65 percent would still consider switching jobs if an opportunity presented itself. To retain their best employees and differentiate in a remote-first work environment, remote leaders need to overcome three common mistakes, and fast.
Mistake #1: Not providing enough constructive feedback. 
When Emplify deployed its survey at the end of October, 67 percent reported that their manager hadnt given them any constructive feedback in the last 30 days. Most of the time, leaders struggle to give constructive feedback for three reasons:
1.    Lack of clarity - The manager doesnt have a clear understanding of how the employee is performing
2.    Lack of competence - The manager doesnt know how to give feedback effectively
3.    Lack of courage - The manager is afraid to give feedback for fear of hurting feelings or the employee responding negatively
Diagnosing the root cause of a failure to give feedback is the first step. If clarity is the issue, how can you get more insight into the individual employees work and performance? If its competence thats holding you back, where can you find best practices for initiating a conversation around feedback? If courage is the issue, who can you talk to that can encourage and hold you accountable? At the end of the day, receiving constructive feedback is foundational to an employees growth. Someone cant improve what theyre not aware of, so failing to provide this insight will do more harm than good in the long run.
Mistake #2: Failing to connect an employees day-to-day work to the organizations mission. 
We all want to know our work mattersand be part of something bigger than ourselves. But almost half of employees (45 percent) reported feeling more disconnected from their organizations mission since going remote. People who find meaning in their work are more likely to perform at a high level and are more engaged. So knowing that people feel detached from the organizations mission, consider implementing a cadence of communication that helps employees see that their work matters beyond meeting deadlines or ticking off boxes on their to-do lists. Additionally, when you celebrate wins, be intentional about sharing the ripple effect of the achievement. For example, lets say youre the leader of an event-planning agency (which, no doubt, has been impacted by the pandemic) and youve just pulled off a successful virtual industry conference. Instead of simply congratulating your employees on a job well done, talk about the number of attendees who learned something that will help them excel in a job theyre passionate about. If youre a sales leader at a project management software company, estimate and celebrate the number of hours youll save the new customer your team just sold. Sometimes all it takes is a little perspective to help employees see that their work matters.
Mistake #3: Not prioritizing professional development for their people. 
Emplifys survey revealed that 47 percent of respondents have had fewer professional development opportunities while working remotely. Since lack of growth opportunities are among the top reasons people leave companies, managers should take this seriously. But before prescribing a course or program, start having conversations with people to set goals for their growth. If an individual contributor is eyeing a promotion to a manager, help her identify the skills shell need to be a people leader before setting her up with a manager development course. Another approach a manager could take is simply acting as the gatekeeper for company time and resources. You could require each of your direct reports to identify a growth area or set a goal, and then give them the autonomy to chart their own course. If you go this route, just make sure to build in some accountability into the process. 
Leading well is difficult in the best of times, never mind during a pandemic. Leveling up your remote leadership skills will take patience and persistence. But as more and more organizations begin hiring remote workers outside of their locality, excellent remote managers will be rewarded with engaged and high-performing teams.

This post will discuss the unique combination of features that Scala provides and how it compares to other languages on the market, diving beneath the superficial experience to explore the fundamentals of the language. From this, you will learn why you might consider including Scala as a valuable addition to your programming toolbox.

The Scala website summarizes the Scala pitch as follows:
Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language. Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.
Scala is a language that provides a unique combination of features that most programmers would appreciate. It combines the performance and large-scale maintainability associated with compiled languages, the tooling and ecosystem of the Java language and virtual machine, and conciseness and ease of use typically associated with scripting languages.
I have been working in the Scala community for the past decade, maintain many of the open source libraries and tools that power the ecosystem, used Scala professionally in a variety of environments, and have seen the language and community evolve over time. Scala has had its hurdles in the past - glacial compilation speeds, confusing libraries and frameworks, and a community more focused on hype than real work. But in the past five years, the Scala ecosystem has managed to move beyond many of these long-standing issues, emerging as a cleaner and more streamlined experience great for Getting Things Done.
In this post, we will first discuss the user-facing selling points that a programmer may appreciate when using Scala, dive into the fundamentals principles that allow the Scala language to be what it is, before closing with a comparison of how this principles compare with other programming languages you may be considering for your next project.
User-facing selling points of the Scala language
In this section, we will discuss some of the user-facing features of the Scala language. These are mentioned briefly in my book Hands-on Scala Programming, but I will go into more detail in this post.
A Compiled Language that feels Dynamic
Scala is a language that scales well from one-line snippets to million-line production codebases, with the convenience of a scripting language and the performance and scalability of a compiled language. Scala's conciseness makes rapid prototyping a joy, while its optimizing compiler and fast JVM runtime provide great performance to support your heaviest production workloads. Rather than being forced to learn a different language for each use case, Scala lets you re-use your existing skills so you can focus your attention on the actual task at hand.
The dichotomy between compiled languages and scripting languages is pervasive throughout the software industry. At a glance, the tradeoffs are as follows:
<table><tr><th>Compiled Language </th><th>Scripting Language </th></tr>
<tr><td>C++, Java, C#, ... </td><td>Python, Ruby, JS, ... </td></tr><tr><td>Verbose </td><td>Concise </td></tr><tr><td>Excellent performance </td><td>Poor performance </td></tr><tr><td>Statically typed </td><td>Dynamically typed </td></tr><tr><td>Great IDE and Tooling Support </td><td>Poor IDE and Tooling Support </td></tr><tr><td>Heavyweight build setups </td><td>Minimal or Lightweight build setups </td></tr><tr><td>Inconvenient in small programs </td><td>Convenient in small programs </td></tr><tr><td>Manageable in large programs </td><td>Unmanageable in large programs </td></tr>
</table>It is always a dilemma as a programmer which one to pick: almost every large program starts off as a small program! It is often not obvious which small programs will become large and which ones never will. A lot of time and effort is wasted developing small programs in compiled languages that never grow big enough for the compiled language overhead to be worth it, or developing large programs in scripting languages because they grew slowly over time well beyond the size that the scripting language is suitable for.
Hybrid Languages
There is a third category of languages: compiled languages that provide type inference, convenient libraries, and other quality of life improvements that blur the line between the Compiled and Scripting languages:
<table><tr><th>Compiled Language </th><th>Scripting Language </th><th>Hybrid Languages </th></tr>
<tr><td>C++, Java, C#, ... </td><td>Python, Ruby, JS, ... </td><td>Scala, F#, Kotlin, ... </td></tr><tr><td>Verbose </td><td>Concise </td><td>Concise</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent performance </td><td>Poor performance </td><td>Excellent performance</td></tr><tr><td>Statically typed </td><td>Dynamically typed </td><td>Statically typed with inference</td></tr><tr><td>Great IDE and Tooling Support </td><td>Poor IDE and Tooling Support </td><td>Great IDE and Tooling Support</td></tr><tr><td>Heavyweight build setups </td><td>Minimal or Lightweight build setups </td><td>Minimal or Lightweight build setups</td></tr><tr><td>Inconvenient in small programs </td><td>Convenient in small programs </td><td>Convenient for small programs</td></tr><tr><td>Manageable in large programs </td><td>Unmanageable in large programs </td><td>Manageable in large programs</td></tr>
</table>Scala is one of this style of ""hybrid"" languages, blending compiled and scripting languages in a way that aims to give you the best of both worlds. You can begin writing useful Scala in a single line of code in the interactive REPL such as Ammonite:
@ requests.post(
 ""https://api.github.com/repos/lihaoyi/test/issues"",
 data = ujson.Obj(""title"" -&gt; ""hello""),
 headers = Map(""Authorization"" -&gt; s""token $token"")
 )
Growing that to a Scala Script if you want to keep the code around:
#!/usr/bin/env amm
val token = os.read(os.pwd / ""github-token.txt"")
requests.post(
 ""https://api.github.com/repos/lihaoyi/test/issues"",
 data = ujson.Obj(""title"" -&gt; ""hello""),
 headers = Map(""Authorization"" -&gt; s""token $token"")
)
./script.sc # run the script
Before growing that into a project with a build tool such as Mill, providing incremental compilation, testing, packaging, and other features that become more and more necessary as your project grows into the 100,000s of lines of code.
Why Use a Hybrid Language?
In a traditional Compiled v.s. Scripting language world, these three use cases would likely have been totally different languages:
<ul><li>Interactive Usage: Bash</li><li>Short Scripts: Python or Ruby</li><li>Larger Systems: Java or C++</li></ul>Converting between these languages usually involves a costly rewrite. It is always a headache trying to figure out when such a rewrite is necessary. We have all seen Bash scripts that have grown too large and would be better written in Python, or Python applications that have grown too large and would be better written in a compiled language like Java or C#!
Lightweight compiled languages like Scala aim to cut this Gordian Knot: you can use the same language for your first line of code in the interactive REPL as you use for your million-line backend distributed systems, and everything in between:
<ul><li>Interactive Usage: Scala</li><li>Short Scripts: Scala</li><li>Larger Systems: Scala</li></ul>At small scales, the Scala REPL and scripts are just as convenient to use as Python or Ruby, while large scale Scala systems are just as maintainable and performant as large-scale systems written in Java or C#.
Scala is not the only language in this category: F# counts, and Swift and Kotlin straddle the line between hybrid and more traditional compiled languages. But Scala is from my experience largely successful at breaking this dichotomy and providing a language that scales from the smallest throwaway one-liner to the largest and most important production systems.
Easy Safety and Correctness
Scala's functional programming style and type-checking compiler helps rule out entire classes of bugs and defects, saving you time and effort you can instead spend developing features for your users. Rather than fighting TypeErrors and NullPointerExceptions in production, Scala surfaces mistakes and issues early on during compilation so you can resolve them before they impact your bottom line. Deploy your code with the confidence that you won't get woken up by outages caused by silly bugs or trivial mistakes.
A large focus of Scala is on the correctness of the code you write.
Any software engineer would know that writing ""a program"" is not the difficult part of their job. The difficulty is making sure their program is correct. Not just doing what you think it should do for all inputs it is expected to receive, but also staying correct as your code evolves over a period of time and is worked on by many different people.
Scala helps with this problem in two ways:
<ol><li>Static Typechecking: Scala's compiler lets you check for many ""trivial"" errors before your program even runs, preventing silly bugs from slipping through and letting the programmer focus on the more subtle and complex issues
</li><li>Functional Programming: a style of designing applications which makes it easier to reason about your application, how it works, and how it can be modified.
</li></ol>I will discuss each approach in turn.
Static Typechecking
Static Typechecking is having a program analyze your code to find issues before you even run it. In compiled languages this is often the compiler itself, but in other languages it may not be: e.g. the Python language provides this in the form of MyPy, a separate checker that can be run whenever you want, but isn't a requirement to execute your code.
Static typechecking is an often religious debate. At a small scale,  It's often up to personal preference: some people prefer static types, some people prefer dynamic languages that do not need nor allow typechecking. Often static typed languages are more verbose than dynamic languages, due to needing type annotations in various parts of your code, although hybrid languages like Scala and F# have type inference that reduces this verbosity.
At small scale, the personal preference between static typechecking doesn't matter. At larger scale, the lack of static typechecking is a huge pain point for anyone maintaining a system. While that was not so clear in the past, today we can see every dynamic language adding support for static typing:
<ul><li>Python's MyPy (by Dropbox and Python core devs)</li><li>Ruby's Sorbet (by Stripe) and RBS (by the Ruby core devs)</li><li>Javascript's Typescript (by Microsoft)</li><li>PHP's Hacklang (by Facebook)</li></ul>We would not see so many large companies spending millions of dollars a year (5-10 full-time silicon valley software engineering salaries) creating type checkers for their dynamic languages if they did not see value in them. The fact is, once you're at a certain scale, the lack-of-static-typechecking in dynamic languages often ends up costing enough millions in lost productivity that this expenditure is worth it.
Another interesting data point is the empirical list of ""top 10 Javascript errors"" from the Rollbar error logging company:
These are as follows:
<ol><li>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property</li><li>TypeError: undefined is not an object</li><li>TypeError: null is not an object</li><li>(unknown): Script error</li><li>TypeError: Object doesnt support property</li><li>TypeError: undefined is not a function</li><li>Uncaught RangeError</li><li>TypeError: Cannot read property length</li><li>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property</li><li>ReferenceError: event is not defined</li></ol>8 of the 10 most common Javascript errors, (1) (2) (3) (5) (6) (8) (9) (10), are all things that a static typechecker would typically catch. No matter how much developers are doing their best to maintain the quality of their Javascript code, it is clear that tons of ""dumb"" type errors are still slipping through to production.  It's no wonder that Typescript has taken off and become so popular so quickly!
While there is sometimes discussion about whether static types or unit tests are a better approach, in reality there is no dichotomy. Static typechecking complements unit tests, and benefits a well-tested codebase as much as it benefit one that is poorly or un-tested. Together with code review, continuous integration, functional programming (which I will discuss below) and other methodologies, these have a cumulative effect of improving your confidence in the correctness of your software.
Even for smaller company which don't have millions to spend add static typing to their language, static typechecking is often worth it if already available. With Scala, static typing is built-in for free.
Functional Programming
In short, ""functional programming"" is programming with a focus on functions that take parameters and return computed values, instead of mutating fields and variables. This tends to make it easier to see what a piece of code needs (its function parameters) and what it does (the value it computes), making it easier to understand, refactor, or add new features to a codebase.
For a more detailed discussion, check of the following post:
Functional programming is not unique to Scala, nor is Scala the language most deeply invested in functional programming. Nonetheless, Scala has a distinctly functional taste: the built-in collections are immutable by default, code often focuses on transforming values rather than mutating variables, and the standard library and ecosystem has many tweaks that allow this functional style to be both convenient and performant.
Most languages are picking up functional-programming features these days:
Languages are picking up functional features because their core developers are finding them a great complement to existing object-oriented and procedural styles. In Scala, Functional Programming has always been a major part of the language and ecosystem, on equal footing with the Object Oriented style that more people may be familiar with. Most teams strike a balance using each approach where appropriate. Scala developers thus reap the benefits of functional programming in helping them organize their code to tackle difficult, complex problems.
A Broad and Deep Ecosystem
As a language running on the Java Virtual Machine, Scala has access to the large Java ecosystem of standard libraries and tools that you will inevitably need to build production applications. Whether you are looking for a Protobuf parser, a machine learning toolkit, a database access library, a profiler to find bottlenecks, or monitoring tools for your production deployment, Scala has everything you need to bring your code to production.
The last major user-facing selling point of Scala is the richness of the ecosystem. When working with code in production, having just a programming language compiler or interpreter is not enough. In a typical week, I will use:
<ol><li>Hundreds of third-party libraries, for all sorts of functionality the language doesn't have built in.</li><li>A package repository, for users to publish and share their code</li><li>Build tools to incrementally compile your code or do so in parallel</li><li>A profiler, to investigate and resolve performance issues</li><li>Monitoring tools, to keep an eye on my code when  It's been deployed to production</li></ol>Scala has all of these, partially on the strengths of its own ecosystem, and partially on the strengths of the Java ecosystem it piggy-backs on.
Maven Central
The Maven Central Java package repository is one of the largest package repositories in the world, with open source libraries available to do literally anything that someone has thought of to do. e.g. if I suddently manipulate PDF files, I can pull in Apache PDFBox off of Maven Central and be off to the races:
import $ivy.`org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox:2.0.18`
val outPath = os.pwd / ""combined.pdf""
val pdfFiles = os.list(os.pwd / ""inputs"")
val merger = new org.apache.pdfbox.multipdf.PDFMergerUtility
for (pdf &lt;- pdfFiles merger.addSource(pdf.toIO)
val out = os.write.outputStream(outPath)
try {
 merger.setDestinationStream(out)
 merger.mergeDocuments()
} finally out.close()
Profilers and Monitoring
Profilers like Java Flight Recorder allow low-overhead monitoring of performance profiles in production, while others like JProfiler or Yourkit can be applied quickly to give immediate insight into the performance characteristics of your application:
Build tools like SBT, Mill, Gradle, Maven, or Bazel provide a menagerie of project management options, with different tradeoffs to suite your requirements.
Many person-decades of work have gone into each and every facet of the Scala/Java ecosystem, and a developer working with Scala benefits from all of it for free.
Fundamental Principles of the Scala Language
The previous section of this post discusses how Scala's unique features directly benefit end users. We will now cover what are the core principles behind Scala that make all of this possible.
All in on Static Analysis
Scala more than most languages focuses on static compilation and analysis. Almost all Scala language features are resolved statically, with even the ""monkey-patch""-esque extension methods and implicit conversions implemented at compile-time rather than runtime. Even compared to other compiled languages like Java, Scala eschews the kind of runtime reflection common in Java code in favor of implicits and other compile-time features.
While doing things at compile time can sometimes be complex, with language features such as implicits and macros having a well-deserved reputation for complexity, such an approach nevertheless offers some fundamental advantages.
Why Static Analysis
Fundamentally, static compilation and analysis means the computer can do more reasoning about your code than if the language did things dynamically at run time.
That means:
<ol><li>Scala like most compiled languages is able to run an order of magnitude faster than dynamic scripting languages, due to the static nature of the code making it easier for the compiler (or JIT compiler) to optimize
</li><li>IDEs like IntelliJ are able to analyze Scala code precisely and accurately. Jump-to-definition, find-usages, refactorings, etc. work much better in statically-typed languages than in dynamic languages.
</li><li>Compile-time generation of things like JSON serializers has excellent performance, whereas runtime-reflection-based implementations tend to be extremely slow. This applies in every language, static or dynamic.
</li><li>The compiler can reason about what the code can do, what the code cannot do, and easily do things like compile your Scala to high-performance Javascript in Scala.js, or to a static binary using Graal Native Image, with perfect compatibility. In contrast, cross-compilers for dynamic languages like Clojure tend to have a long-list of caveats and incompatibilites
</li></ol>In general, having a language focused around static compilation and static analysis means the computer can help you out more in whatever you are doing: whether you are trying to find usages of a variable, renaming some method, or just trying to make your code blazing fast. These are all things that software engineers do day-in and day-out, and  It's great to have tools that are able to help automate this work as much as possible!
Other Languages Pushing Static Analysis
Scala isn't the only language which has realized the multi-faceted benefits of static compilation. Even Python, the poster-child of dynamic languages, has:
This is a story that has played out many times in the past, and we can expect it to play out many times in the future. Fundamentally, the promise of having the computer do more work to help the programmer understand, debug, refactor, or optimize their code is too great to ignore. But In order to realize those gains, we need a language that the computer is effectively able to statically analyze. Scala is already such a language.
Inference for Ease of Use
Perhaps the most interesting thing about Scala is that it leans heavily on inference in order to make things easy to use. Consider this snippet that uses Scala to render a simple HTML fragment:
os.write(
 os.pwd / ""index.html"",
 body(
 h1(""Blog""),
 for (postTitle &lt;- postTitles)
 yield h2(postTitle)
 )
)
Without type inference, it would look something like:
os.write(
 os.pwd / ""index.html"",
 body(
 h1(new StringFrag(""Blog"")),
 new SeqFrag(
 for (postTitle: String &lt;- postTitles)
 yield h2(new StringFrag(postTitle))
 )
)
While both snippets are understandable, it is clear how much work the inferred new StringFrag and new SeqFrag constructors and the inferred : String annotation are doing to keep our code clean and concise. The top snippet feels like something you'd see in a dynamic language, while the bottom snippet feels distinctly Enterprise Java-y.
These days, type-inference is becoming table stakes for compiled languages: newer typecheckers for dynamic languages like Ruby or Python use type inference heavily, and even more traditional compiled languages like Java are moving in that direction. Scala is a language built from the ground up around type inference, which ends up being much more coherent and well-designed in Scala than in other languages bolting it on after-the-fact.
Value Inference
Scala is perhaps unique among programming languages that it doesn't just infer type annotations (""type inference""), but it can also infer constructors/conversions (as seen above) or other values.
Consider the following snippet, which defines an Example[T] trait with a single value, and a function exampleFor[T] that lets us grab the value for any T for which we have an example defined:
@ trait Example[T]{ def value: T }
@ def exampleFor[T: Example] = implicitly[Example[T]].value
We can define examples for Int and String using the implicit syntax below:
@ implicit object ExampleInt extends Example[Int]{def value = 1213}
@ implicit object ExampleString extends Example[String]{def value = ""moo""}
@ exampleFor[Int]
res6: Int = 1213
@ exampleFor[String]
res7: String = ""moo""
exampleFor[Int] looks for any implicit value with the type Example[Int], finds ExampleInt, and returns the value 1213. Ditto for exampleFor[String], so far so good.
Where this gets interesting is when you define Examples that depend on other Examples, e.g.
@ implicit def ExampleTuple[T: Example, V: Example]: Example[(T, V)] = new Example[(T, V)]{
 def value = (implicitly[Example[T]].value, implicitly[Example[V]].value)
 }
Here we are defining an Example[(T, V)], or an example of a 2-element tuple, for elements of any type for which there is already an Example defined. Now, not only can we ask for exampleFor[(Int, String)] or exampleFor[(String,
Int)]:
@ exampleFor[(Int, String)]
res9: (Int, String) = (1213, ""moo"")
@ exampleFor[(String, Int)]
res10: (String, Int) = (""moo"", 1213)
We can also ask for exampleFors of deeply nested tuples, as long as they are made of Ints, Strings and 2-element tuples:
@ exampleFor[((String, String), (Int, Int))]
res11: ((String, String), (Int, Int)) = ((""moo"", ""moo""), (1213, 1213))
@ exampleFor[((String, Int), (Int, String))]
res12: ((String, Int), (Int, String)) = ((""moo"", 1213), (1213, ""moo""))
@ exampleFor[((String, Int), (((Int, String), Int), String))]
res13: ((String, Int), (((Int, String), Int), String)) = (
 (""moo"", 1213),
 (((1213, ""moo""), 1213), ""moo"")
)
While most programming languages allow you to take an expression (1213, ""moo"") and infer the type (Int, String), Scala allows you to go the other direction: take the type (Int, String) and infer a value (1213, ""moo"")! This is tremendously useful in a whole range of different scenarios, and allows the Scala language to be as concise as dynamic languages while still preserving its statically-typed nature.
For a deeper dive into how this value-inference technique works and is useful, check out this section in my book on Typeclass Inference:
Do What I Mean
Being able to specify the type of the value you want, and have your compiler automatically generate the code to provide it, is something unique to Scala. Scala achieves this not through clever hacks or revolutionary AI, but instead through a well-defined set of rules in where your program can infer types and values. Fundamentally, this kind of flexible program-inference is the closest we can get to a holy grail of a ""do what I mean"" language.
Lean Heavily on the Host Language
The last thing that Scala does well is to lean heavily on the host language for both its language semantics as well as its implementation. Scala is typically run on the JVM, which together with the Java ecosystem provides a host of useful things that Scala doesn't need to worry about:
<ol><li>Multithreading</li><li>Package Management and a Package Ecosystem</li><li>IDEs and editors</li><li>Profilers for CPU and Memory usage</li><li>JIT compilation</li><li>AOT compilation (e.g. using Graal Substrate VM)</li><li>Debuggers</li><li>Garbage collectors (several to choose from!)</li></ol>While the JVM has limitations, I think that it is clear that Scala has benefited massively from piggy-backing on the JVM and Java ecosystem. Consider the state of multi-threading in Ocaml, which has been ""work in progress"" for years:
Piggy-backing on the JVM, Scala inherited a fully-working, well-defined and battle-tested multi-threading implementation. Rather than spending person-decades on re-implementing a multithreaded memory model, threading, atomics, locks, semaphores, volatiles, etc., the Scala community could focus on the usability and ergonomics that really makes the language unique.
These days Scala also runs in the browser via Scala.js, which is another example of successfully bootstrapping a rich community on top of an existing well-trodden ecosystem.
Conclusion: All Languages lead to Scala
Every programming language is subject to the same pressures: for better performance, tooling, convenience, correctness, or maintainability at scale. I have already discussed why I think Scala has both a good superficial featureset, as well as a sound underlying approach. Scala focuses on helping software engineers with their most practical challenges, with good fundamentals to ensure that it gets good mileage out of the efforts of the community.
Programming languages are diverse, but in many ways they are getting less diverse over time. Consider the state of the mainstream programming languages a decade ago, circa 2010:
<table><tr><th></th><th>Execution Style </th><th>Types </th><th>Perf </th><th>Records </th><th>Pattern Matching </th><th>Lambdas </th></tr>
<tr><td>C++ </td><td>Compiled </td><td>Static </td><td>Great </td><td>Yes </td><td>No </td><td>No </td></tr><tr><td>Java </td><td>Compiled + JIT </td><td>Static </td><td>Good </td><td>No </td><td>No </td><td>No </td></tr><tr><td>C# </td><td>Compiled + JIT </td><td>Static / Inferred </td><td>Good </td><td>No </td><td>No </td><td>Yes </td></tr><tr><td>Python </td><td>Interpreted </td><td>Dynamic </td><td>Poor </td><td>No </td><td>No </td><td>Yes </td></tr><tr><td>Ruby </td><td>Interpreted </td><td>Dynamic </td><td>Poor </td><td>No </td><td>No </td><td>Yes </td></tr><tr><td>JS </td><td>Interpreted + JIT </td><td>Dynamic </td><td>Ok </td><td>Yes </td><td>No </td><td>Yes </td></tr><tr><td>Scala </td><td>Compiled + JIT </td><td>Inferred </td><td>Good </td><td>Yes </td><td>Yes </td><td>Yes </td></tr>
</table>At the time, Scala was definitely the odd one out: with inferred types for conciseness, and functional programming features like records (case classes in Scala), pattern matching, and lambda functions. The divide between the compiled languages and the interpreted languages was stark. But over time, as the industry evolved, the landscape of the same languages looks very different today, post-2020:
<table><tr><th></th><th>Execution Style </th><th>Types </th><th>Perf </th><th>Records </th><th>Pattern Matching </th><th>Lambdas </th></tr>
<tr><td>C++ </td><td>Compiled </td><td>Static </td><td>Great </td><td>Yes </td><td>No </td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Java </td><td>Compiled + JIT </td><td>Static / Inferred</td><td>Good </td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>C# </td><td>Compiled + JIT </td><td>Static / Inferred </td><td>Good </td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes </td></tr><tr><td>Python </td><td>Interpreted / Compiled</td><td>Dynamic / Inferred</td><td>Poor </td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes </td></tr><tr><td>Ruby </td><td>Interpreted / JIT</td><td>Dynamic / Inferred</td><td>Poor </td><td>No </td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes </td></tr><tr><td>JS </td><td>Interpreted + JIT </td><td>Dynamic / Inferred</td><td>Ok </td><td>Yes </td><td>No </td><td>Yes </td></tr><tr><td>Scala </td><td>Compiled + JIT </td><td>Inferred </td><td>Good </td><td>Yes </td><td>Yes </td><td>Yes </td></tr>
</table>The fact that every language is evolving should not come as a surprise to anyone, but what may be surprising is that every language is evolving towards the same place: they are all becoming JIT-compiled-ish, inferred-typed languages with functional programming features like records, pattern matching, and lambdas. Obviously the details of this diverse set of languages vary tremendously, but the direction they are heading is clear. Newer languages like Kotlin or Swift also tend to fit the same mold.
Scala already satisfies most of these criteria. Whether you are building a programming language, a website, or a large-scale distributed system, Scala is an excellent foundation to make it happen.
In the last few years, we have seen the Ruby and Python core developers moving mountains trying to implement JITs and static-compilation for performance. The Java and C# folks have been trying hard to make their language more ergonomic and approachable. Everyone has been trying to graft on functional-programming features.
Despite these efforts, retro-fitting these features onto an existing language never fits quite as nicely as a language that was designed with them from scratch. The type system grafted onto Python doesn't have quite the same elegance or performance benefit of a true compiled language, and the ergonomic improvements to Java are but a small respite that doesn't bring it close to the convenience of a scripting language. Despite the herculean efforts, trying to catch up in this way is truly a sisyphean task.
If you trace their efforts to the ultimate conclusion, there is already a language there that does everything they'd want:  It's Scala.

53,john@modernmsg.com,"John!?!Modern Message!?!One of the things that has become clear right now is that virtual connections and communications have never been more essential. Even though audiences and demographics may differ from community to community everyone is working towards the same goal, to increase resident retention and referrals. One of the best ways to drive these results is through rewards & incentives, especially when  It's free.

Having worked with thousands of communities over the past 7 years, from student and multifamily housing to military and affordable housing, we have been able to observe the best practices to engage with your residents from across the industry. Even now, as the nation begins to reopen from quarantine stemming from Covid-19, we want to ensure that we continue to deliver best in class solutions that can fit into any work environment. 

There are countless ways that virtual incentives can be used at your multifamily and student communities.  In just the past few months of quarantine, we've seen our customers offer rewards for:

Renewals and Referrals
New Leases
Resolve service issues
Resident appreciation gifts
Recognition to residents who may be going above and beyond 
Virtual event participation
Top Brands in May 2020
We've also continued to watch the most popular Reward Cards redeemed from residents the past few months. The clear winners are online shopping and food delivery services, with a noticeable reduction in travel. The top 10 brands include the following national brands:

Virtual Visa
Amazon
Target
Best Buy
Nike
Uber
Sephora
Uber Eats
Nordstrom
Ulta Beauty
If incentives are a part of your overall leasing and loyalty strategy, our Custom Incentives Program is an easy to use service that gives apartment communities the ability to electronically deliver digital, on-demand Reward Cards directly to residents without having any physical interaction. Other ways that our Custom Incentives Program can save you time and money:

Free to Send Rewards 
There is no cost to Community Rewards customers (no monthly, activation, or processing fees)
Over 100 brands for residents to choose from and  It's 100% DIGITAL (reduces time to manage and buy gift cards)
Get 100% of money back on all unclaimed incentives
Full accountability and reporting for incentives sent (eliminate fraud and theft)

52,sean.hurwitz@pixovr.com,"Sean!?!PIXO VR!?!Royal Oak, Michigan, Aug. 04, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Extended reality (XR) solutions company, PIXO, which recently made news with its VR Training collaboration with global engineering firm Bosch and Big Three automaker Ford Motor Company, has announced the launch of ‘PIXO Apex’, a first-of-its-kind XR content distribution, management, and analytics platform designed to make XR easier than ever for enterprise clients and other major organizations to deploy, use, and scale. Critically, this new platform stands apart from other solutions with its ability to manage all three XR technologies, including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) applications, with a single, cloud-based system. 

 

Fortune magazine recently estimated the XR industry will grow to $250 billion by 2026, particularly in light of the need for more remote and virtual work, collaboration, and training solutions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But that rapid growth has created its own challenges, said PIXO Founder and CEO Sean Hurwitz. 

“PIXO Apex solves issues around content, hardware, and distribution on a global scale which have, up until now, held the industry back from reaching its full potential,” Hurwitz said, referencing common implementation hurdles he’s witnessed since his company first started developing virtual reality training solutions for business in 2016.  

 

“Enterprise VR Training is an important space for us and why we invested in PIXO last year,” said Angelo Del Priore, partner at HP Tech Ventures, the venture capital arm of HP Inc. “In PIXO, we see a company delivering compelling XR solutions to customers across industries like construction, manufacturing, energy, and public safety.”

 

Hurwitz said the beauty of his company’s new platform is its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. With PIXO Apex, organizations that need content can access a growing library of VR, AR, and MR titles, license what they want, then provision that content to a wide variety of popular XR headsets, including models from HP, Oculus, HTC, and Pico, as well as non-XR digital devices. Organizations that already have content, developed internally or by third parties, can also distribute and manage it simply by integrating those titles with the PIXO Apex platform’s web-based API.

 

Perhaps even more exciting for the XR industry is what happens on the user end. Once VR, AR, or MR titles are provisioned to devices, authenticated users can securely download experiences to tethered, head-mounted displays (HMDs) or directly to tetherless, standalone headsets without the need to individually sideload content. SCORM-compliant data, session duration, and other user metrics can be viewed in real-time on an organization’s reporting dashboard and can be integrated into a company’s existing learning management system, (LMS).

 

By offering content, distribution, and management, PIXO Apex represents a complete, end-to-end, XR solution, offered on a monthly subscription basis. Further, third-party XR developers can partner with PIXO to license and distribute their own content, and affiliates and associations can offer their members easy access to a library of curated, immersive learning experiences, particularly for industries where on-site, instructor-led training is often too difficult, dangerous, or expensive to conduct, particularly with the added complications of a post-COVID world. 

 

“Apex makes XR for training, design, collaboration, and endless other uses more affordable and accessible to companies, developers, associations, and resellers, helping to grow the industry,” Hurwitz said. “XR provides more immersive, interactive, and meaningful experiences for everyone, especially those now entering the workforce, who have grown up along with this technology through gaming and entertainment. PIXO Apex is XR for the entire world.”


Please join the PIXO team at the VR/AR Global Summit, Sept. 16-18.  For more information, visit pixovr.com.

PIxoApex",I found it really impressive that the new PIXO Amex can manage all three XR technologies. I can’t imagine how much work that must have taken you guys. How are people looking forward to using these together?,
51,todd@veristream.com,"Todd!?!Veristream!?!A multi-location Enterprise faces a host of challenges when it comes to security at each site, including visitor management. Whether your facilities are scattered locally or internationally, ideally, you want a single visitor management solution able to meet the demands of every location you’re monitoring. Choosing a single solution to use companywide reduces training costs for the time it takes to learn multiple systems. Stay uniform with centralized reporting, easily standardized visitor policies, and run real-time reports from a global dashboard.

“When I thought about needing to know who was on-site, this was the most innovative solution I knew of for such a task,” stated Brian Phillips, Associate Director of Physical Security, Technology, & Integration. For Alexion Pharmaceuticals, one of the key attractions to Veristream was the reduced demand for the company’s own staff. “Our global security team is the security support for most of our sites,” Phillips said. “Most are very small in headcount, so they don’t have a dedicated person to help. Having a secure online system where I can say, ‘Hey, just hit this URL and you are up and running,’ was important to me. Anywhere we can rely less on support from IT, we are trying to go that route. If I can support it from my end by having that secure online system, it works better for me and for IT as well.”

 
Low-Risk, High-Reward with Visitor Management
Once you have purchased BreezN, our visitor management system, the next question is when and how to implement it. Whether you have a single location, 35 across the US, or 250 international sites, the process for implementation is the same regardless of locations. By purchasing our software, it is easily set up for numerous locations at once. After purchasing hardware for each location, all that’s left to do is set up admins and an employee database. Our team assists with onboarding and training to set you up for success.

Most adoption strategies are associated with varying levels of low-high risk and low-high cost, but with visitor management, the risk and cost are low. The risk associated with switching from a paper system to a digital check-in system is low.

Using a direct adoption strategy to remove the paper logbook and replace it with an iPad kiosk has low risk. Even if you wanted to run them parallel, the first day would show how easy and convenient the digital system is to use for visitors and your staff. A pilot strategy is good if you’re hesitant to deploy the system across all of your locations at one time. We then assist you with an implementation strategy, that pilots the program at a single location for 30 days, and then creates a plan for the remainder of your locations to come onboard within the first year.

The cost also remains low throughout the entire partnership. The software runs on an annual subscription, and we price per location, not per kiosk. Some of our competitors will charge a software subscription per kiosk, so if you’ve got 3 entry points for 1 building, you could be paying 3x the amount for a single location. The cost can add up quickly if all of your locations need numerous kiosks.

Uniform Visitor Check-In Process
Enterprise companies have come to us for the last decade to find innovative ways to solve their visitor management problems. It is no easy task to manage operating costs and procedures for numerous locations. Handling ineffective visitor check-in processes and problems with escort policy enforcement, only make this management more challenging.

Our visitor management software provides a standardized solution that runs across every location to reduce the burden on local staff and corporate resources. Will Ellis, Senior Technical Analyst, of AMB Sports + Entertainment, which manages organizations like the Atlanta Falcons told us, “We have numerous sites throughout our company, and all have been implemented seamlessly. This product has enabled us to better manage our visitors while also increasing our security. Overall, we have had an outstanding experience with Veristream. The support as well as the product has been top-notch.”

Competitive Advantage:
Recurring visitors, categorize up to 12 different types of visitors
ID scanning included for no extra charge
We price per location, not per kiosk
Private dedicated environment, the highest level of data security

50,chad.meyer@internetcreations.com,"Chad!?!Internet Creations!?!This blog post features Salesforce Lightning Productivity Tips for End Users, specifically tips on how to efficiently find and work with records, how to leverage new Lightning features, and how to maximize your effectiveness using Lightning apps. The goal is to help you enhance your productivity while using Salesforce Lightning.

As we approach the 5-year anniversary of the release of the Salesforce Lightning Experience (LEX), we are now working with a platform that has not only caught up with Classic but has far surpassed it in terms of available functionality and new release updates. For those of you who might be new to Salesforce, the Lightning Experience is the newer user interface (UI) on the Salesforce Platform, whereas Classic represents the old UI. As of January 2020, Salesforce has turned on Lightning Experience through a Critical Update and is continuing to strongly advocate for LEX. Now is the time to embrace Lightning if you have yet to do so.

In my work both as a Salesforce Admin and Consultant, end users have strongly benefited from tips on how to enhance their productivity using Lightning. In fact, I was a Salesforce end user for several years before stepping into a technical position, which has enabled me to have a better understanding of end users’ needs. These tips will be quick wins for you, the end user, with little to no customization by your admin.

Conclusion
1. Finding and Working with Records Faster
Pinning List Views Saves Clicks
List views are a great way to access records in Salesforce. Something to keep in mind is that in a list view, you can only access records and fields from the object whose tab you are on. In Lightning, there are a few features that you want to make sure to take advantage of.

Note: List views are often created by the administrator for your use. Depending on your access, you might be able to create your own list views or clone existing ones.

The default list view is the “Recently Viewed” list view. This has caused confusion more than once because users might not see any records or only a few (the ones they’ve recently viewed). To avoid seeing the “Recently Viewed” list view as your default, select your most frequently used list view and click the “pin” icon to pin that list view. After pinning the list view, it will open up as the default list view for that object from then on and save you several clicks each time.

Demo of pinning the case list view
Clicking on the cases tab, shows the “Recently Viewed” list view. We select the “All Open Cases” list view and pin it. Then we go to the home page and back to the cases tab and see the “All Open Cases” list view as the default.

Salesforce Help: Pin List Views in Lightning Experience

Kanban List Views for Efficiency
Another useful list view feature is the Kanban view. Per Atlassian, “Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile software development. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.” The Kanban View is Salesforce’s implementation of the Kanban Board allowing you to visualize records as cards and easily update them, thus maximizing efficiency.

You can select a picklist and display it as a Kanban board, which allows you to edit the records by simply dragging them around. Click on the Display settings and select “Kanban”. Choose which field to order by and which field to summarize by.

Demo of the Kanban List View. It shows how to change the Display Settings and Kanban Settings. Shows how to drag a card from one stage to the next.
We select “Kanban” in the “Display settings”. Next, we go to the “List View Control Settings” and select “Kanban Settings”. This is where you specify the fields to “Summarize By” and “Group By”. For the Opportunity list view, we select “Amount” and “Stage”. As you can see, the opportunities display as cards on the Kanban Board. The dropdown arrow allows you to edit, delete, or change the owner. The warning sign means you have no open activities and allows you to create a new task or event. By dragging the card to a different stage, you can easily progress the opportunity.

Get Guidance on your Company’s Processes with Kanban Views
As of Summer ‘20, you can also access fields from the compact layout and key fields and guidance from your object’s path in the Kanban List View. Simply click on the details panel (1) and you will see the compact layout fields (2) and key fields and guidance for success (3) from the path. This update is quite useful because it allows you to see more information about the record without having to leave the Kanban List View.

Note: A path must be configured by your Admin in Path Settings in Setup. For more information, view this article.

Screenshot showing the new Summer '20 feature related to Kanban List Views. You can now display the fields from the compact layout and key fields and guidance for success from the path.
Release Notes: Get Guidance on Your Company’s Processes in Kanban Views

Open Records with Split List Views
When using a Console App and as of Summer ‘20 a standard-navigation App as well, you have the option of displaying list views in “Split View”, which allows you to save both time and clicks by having records open and accessing the list view at the same time. Thus, you can open other records immediately, without needing to go back to the list view first. To do so, go to “Display Settings” and select “Split View”. 

Demo showing the Split List View.
We select a cases list view, open it, and change the display settings to “Split View”. Then we use the split list view to select other cases.

Release Notes: Work Through Lists with Ease Using Split View for Standard Navigation

Make Changes Quickly with List View Inline Editing
Though a feature not unique to Lightning, many people aren’t familiar with list view inline editing, so I wanted to highlight it. You can edit records directly in a list view, which can make you much more productive since you don’t have to open each record individually. 

Note: If the object you are referencing has multiple record types, you need to filter by one record type in order to inline edit using a list view. There are also some fields that are not available or inline editing. For more information, please view this help article.

Demo showing inline editing in list views.
We click on the pencil icon in the top right to enable inline editing. Using inline editing, we edit the Opportunity Name, Close Date, and Stage of the opportunity. Don’t forget to save your changes once you are done.

Salesforce Help: Update Records Inline from a List View in Lightning Experience

Subscribe to Reports for Relevant Notifications
A great way to enhance your productivity is to subscribe to reports. Rather than manually checking a report every day, subscribe to the report and set conditions so that you are notified when you need to take action or be aware of something. For example, I am subscribed to a report for Case Comments without time stub with conditions to only email me if the record count is greater than 0. By doing so, I am notified to remind myself to log time against the case that I worked on. Don’t forget to set a schedule for the report to email you. You can select the frequency, days, and time.

Note: You must have the “Subscribe to Reports” permission to do this.

Demo showing how to subscribe to a report.
In the report, we click the dropdown and select “Subscribe”. Then we show the Frequency options. Next, we select the Frequency “Daily” and Time “10:00 PM”. We check “Add conditions to this report” and set the conditions to be “Record Count Greater or Equal to 1”. Lastly, we save the report subscription.

Salesforce Help: Schedule and Subscribe to Reports

Attach Files to Report Subscriptions
Note: This feature must be enabled by an Admin. For more information, view this article.

As of Summer ‘20, you can now attach .csv files (Details Only reports) and .xlsx Excel files (Formatted Report) to report subscriptions. While setting up the report subscription, click on Attach File, select your Export View, and save. This feature saves you time if you want to access your data outside of Salesforce.

Screenshot showing how to attach a file to a report subscription.

Search to Find Records Quickly
Search is powerful in Lightning. If you need to find a record quickly or aren’t sure what object the information is on, use search. 

Screenshot showing Search in Salesforce Lightning with number 1 on the global search bar and number 2 on the five recent items.
Search automatically shows the last five records (2) that were accessed when you click in the global search bar (1) on the top of the page. 

Screenshot showing Search in Lightning with number 3 showing the word ""Texas"" typed in the global search bar, number 4 showing ""Texas"" as a suggested search, number 5 showing ""Texas"" in Opportunities, number 6 showing results with the word ""Texas"", and number 7 showing the dropdown to narrow down the object.
Once you start typing (3), several search options appear. The first search area will search for the keyword in the most used objects (4), the second search option searches for the keyword in the object that you are on (5), lastly, it will show you a limited number of results that meet the keyword (6). You can also use the dropdown beside the global search (7) to narrow down the search to any searchable object from anywhere in Salesforce. When you click enter, you will see the top results based on the keyword and the objects you use most frequently. To see more objects, search for the object on the left side bar.

Einstein Search
Note: Einstein Search must be enabled by an administrator. For more information, visit this help article.

Now, with Einstein Search, Salesforce increases productivity with AI for every customer. Einstein Search can personalize results for every user, show relevant results from natural language queries, and let you take actions directly from the search bar for quicker time to value.

Screenshot showing Einstein Search in Lightning.
As you can see, the search options by default are a bit different than before. While you still have the Global Search (1) and Object dropdown (2), you now have three search selections (3) as well as five recently accessed records based on the object you’re on (4) as well as recently accessed list views (5). Seeing Einstein (6) is how you know that Einstein Search is enabled.

Screenshot showing Einstein Search with the keyword ""Internet Creations"" typed into the global search.
When you start typing using Einstein Search, several results show up based on the keyword with the option to show more results (7). If you hover over one of the results, it will show you information about the record including fields, actions, and related list quick links (8). You can now take action directly from your search results.

2. Usability Tips
Favorites for Easier Access
Favorites is one of my favorite Lightning features (no pun intended), which allows you to mark certain records, dashboards, reports, etc. in order to quickly access them from any page (not available on setup pages). Whenever you favorite something in Lightning, it shows up in a special place in the list of reports, dashboards, and the navigation bar dropdown on standard apps. It is worth noting that not all content can be favorited (click here for more information).

Demo showing how to use the Favorites feature in Salesforce Lightning.
We open the SolarBot Impact Dashboard and click the star icon to favorite it. Go to the home page and access the dashboard from the favorite dropdown beside the star icon.

For example, my favorites in Internet Creations’ Salesforce org include a record to manage the 1-on-1 meetings with my manager, my team’s dashboard, my personal performance dashboard, my Kanban cases list view, my open cases list view, my planned work manager, our all staff group, and more.

Screenshot showing my favorites in the Internet Creations Salesforce Org.

Display Density (Comfy or Compact)
You have the option to change the display density settings of the detail fields on records. Your choice is between Comfy (field label above the field value) or Compact (field label beside the field value).

Comfy        Compact
        
As you can see, the compact density setting condenses the fields, so that you can see more details in one area. To change the density setting, go to your profile photo in the top right and select the density setting.

Demo showing how to change the display density in Lightning.
We click on our profile icon on the top right, go to display density and change the the Display Density to “Compact”. We confirm to refresh now. Then we change the Display Density back to Comfy and refresh now.

3. General Lightning App Functionality
Utility Bar Provides Quick Access to Productivity Tools
Note: The utility bar depends on the configuration your admin has set up. If you do not see some of these features, submit a request to your admin to set it up. For more information, visit this help article.

The purpose behind the utility bar is to give users quick access to items that are frequently accessed. The utility bar can be configured differently for each application. Some examples for useful utilities include notes, macros, history, recent records, CTI softphone, omni-channel, custom solutions, and more. The utility bar is at the bottom of your Salesforce app in Lightning. Keep in mind that several of the applications mentioned (such as macros, CTI softphone, and omni-channel) apply to support agents more than other types of users.

Screenshot showing the Utility Bar in Lightning.
In the screenshot, you can see that the utility bar (bottom left) is configured to show the phone, macros, history, notes, and omni-channel utilities.

Salesforce Help: Add a Utility Bar to Lightning Apps

Customize Navigation Bar to Prioritize Your Items
An admin configures your apps for you and selects what objects are available in your navigation bar. While you cannot remove what they have selected, you can rearrange the order and also add additional items (e.g. objects or records) to your navigation bar. For example, if the dashboard tab is not in the navigation bar and you need to access it frequently, you can simply add it. There are many ways to customize the navigation bar and prioritize items that you frequently access.

Demo showing how to customize your navigation bar.
We click on the pencil icon to customize the navigation bar. Next, we rearrange the account object to be in the front, add our favorite opportunity (Sponsorship Package), and add Chatter. Once that is completed, we save the navigation bar. Next, we click on the dropdown on account, open the Salesforce account record in the navigation bar, and save it to the navigation bar. Then, we go to the App Launcher, search for Dashboards, open it, and add it to the navigation bar. Finally, we click on the pencil icon again to customize the navigation bar and “Reset Navigation to Default”.

Salesforce Help: Personalize the Navigation Bar in Lightning Experience

App Launcher to Find All Apps and Items
The App Launcher recently got an upgrade in Salesforce. Instead of taking up the entire screen, it now only shows a small dropdown when clicked. The App Launcher allows you to select the apps you want to use and gives you access to all items and objects. If you can’t find what you want in the navigation bar, click the App Launcher icon in the top left and search for it. You can also click “View All” to see all available apps and items.

Demo showing how to use the App Launcher in Lightning.
We click on the App Launcher and search for “Lemonade” and open the “Lemonade” app. Later on, we open the App Launcher again, search for “Dashboard” and open it.

4. Lightning Console App
The Lightning Console App enables you to view multiple records and their related records on the same screen in different tabs. You can easily switch between different records, which is useful in a fast-paced environment. For more information, visit this help article.

Pin Tabs for Frequent Access
When using a console app in Lightning, there may be certain tabs that are very important or that you access quite frequently (e.g. important records, the homepage). To have the tab stay in that place, you can pin it by clicking on the arrow and selecting “Pin Tab”.

Screenshot showing how to pin a tab in the Lightning Console App.
Click on the arrow on the tab and select “Pin Tab”.

Customize Tabs to Better Identify the Record
When you are working on records in the console, it can quickly become difficult to distinguish what record you are wanting to open, especially when they have auto numbered names (e.g. cases). By utilizing the “Customize Tab” feature, you can change the name and the icon of the tab to more easily identify the record you are wanting to access.

Demo showing how to customize tabs in the Lightning Console App.
In the console app, we have opened several cases for United Oil & Gas. It is difficult to distinguish between the different cases, unless you memorize the case numbers. We decide to customize the “Help with Solar Panel” to display “Solar Panel – 00001035” and an icon that looks like solar panels instead of “00001035” and the case icon.

Modernization is sometimes nothing more than the manifestation of a common collective of ideas that consumers find desirable. This definition works well for shirts or sneakers, but may not be the formula that you want to apply to an IT organization.

For many of us, we must consider modernization through a lens of valuable impact. New sneakers may look 'cool', but what are the relevant KPIs? Can they make someone run faster, jump higher, score more points? Can they be manufactured cheaper, or enable customer defined designs with a short delivery window?

A retail bank may seek to modernize to appeal to a demographic of consumers who want a stylish bank…one that says the 'right things' in a commercial, has a lobby that looks like a coffee bar, or sponsors an Indy car. How you appear to a customer is quite often unrelated to how you operate on behalf of the customer. LL Cool J’s Kangol hat did not make him a better rapper but may have helped him establish his brand and sell more records.

Retail consumers are not direct buyers of IT operations. IT cannot state that the desired outcome of modernization is to have a cool aesthetic - leave that to the lobby designers. IT change must be held to a standard of valuable outcomes measured as KPIs; if that objective is achieved, and IT looks cool doing it, that is fine too.

DevOps for example can be a fashion statement, or it can be the enabler of technology driven business value targets. Who is your consumer - your business partner, or your IT buddies?

Containerization can be an IT aesthetic that dresses up an application portfolio to look cool, or, under the right circumstances, can solve an important business challenge.

Are you actually going jogging, or do you just want to look like you are going jogging? Should you buy 'lifestyle sneakers' or 'running shoes'. What is your destination and desired outcome? Assessing and understanding your motivation for change is critical.

 It's unlikely that you will see a runner win the Berlin marathon wearing a pair of $10,000 Yeezy sneakers, but you will see Justin Bieber wearing them in concert. Bieber understands his consumer and selects the right outcome enabler; a marathon runner does the same. These are two entirely different, but entirely suitable, decisions about what change to make based on desired outcomes.

IT can be fashionable, but someone once said, “smart is sexy”.

In IT, do you want to look sexy, or be sexy?",I hope to see the technology narcissist piece on the sexiness of IT in the next issue of Vogue! How are you planning to build on the image of IT you have made next?,
48,tonyabarr@tsav.com,"Tonya!?!TSAV!?!TSAV Clients, Business Partners and Friends,

The COVID-19 Pandemic is affecting all of us. These are unprecedented circumstances calling for action on all of our parts.  Industries are paused, personal lives in flux, and varying interpretations of mandated shutdowns and restrictions on work are cause for confusion and inefficiency.  At TSAV, we’ve taken the circumstances as a call to action on all of our active projects. Our team is 100% mobilized and is heavily focused on gaining new efficiencies, so our work in the field can be even more rapid, thorough, and comprehensive than ever.  And, we are succeeding in doing so through doubling efforts on a wide variety of granular facets of the technical work that we love. This aggressive approach matches our aggressive focus on integrity, stewardship of your resources, stewardship of time, and our uncompromising commitment to our collective success.  

 Our responsibility to our Nation and our communities is unwavering as well.   We are working weekdays and weekends to comply with both the letter and the spirit of the recommendations being made by our Government and medical community while keeping our commitments and our partners at the front of our efforts.  Through our robust technology infrastructure, any and all work that can be done remotely is being done at home. And, staying focused on NIH, CDC, and WHO efforts to “flatten the curve” of infection rates, any other work that can be done at the end of this period of distancing and isolation is being pushed.  

 I’d like to reiterate that we are, simultaneously, working longer hours and longer weeks than we were before this time, and this work is providing new efficiencies for the impending site work.   Where critical efforts are required, we are committed and ready to work with you to resolve related issues.  

 It is very important to also note that intense analysis of project schedules has been completed. Review and updates to these schedules, verification of associated dependencies, and confirmation of the required “depth of bench” needed is happening daily.  As a result, we have not identified any gaps in project schedules nor do we anticipate any issues with adherence to our planned completion dates. As these schedules are updated daily, we will work with you immediately and directly to resolve any associated concerns should they come to light.    

Formally, TSAV is complying with State mandates that all non-essential service companies are ordered to shelter in place.  Accordingly, work on-site which is non-essential to project success is being deferred per shelter in place timelines. Essential functions are being performed and these include preparing in new ways with stronger focus on what we all are called to do in the coming weeks.

TSAV is open and operating.  Feel free to contact us if you have any concerns. We will continue to be there to support our clients and our partners in these challenging times.  Best wishes to you and your families. And, as always, keep safety first.

Kind Regards,

Pete Dugas, President

46,bonnie@schoolwebmasters.com,"Bonnie!?!School Webmasters!?!We can all agree that customer service is a part of K–12 education these days. In fact, there isn’t any sector in which customer service isn’t an expectation if the company or organization expects to remain relevant (or in business).

Admittedly, the type of customer service we must deliver in education is different from retail or other service organizations, but essential nonetheless. It is actually a bit more complex because our relationships are more so. Our services go beyond briefly serving our customers. Our interactions affect students’ lives, helping them to become responsible, contributing members of society (while partnering, encouraging, and engaging their parents at the same time).

Today, unlike in the not too distant past, public schools were the only game in town, so parents and students were forced to accept the status quo. When bureaucracy and rudeness reared its ugly head, a bit of whining and complaining was the only recourse. Not so today—and maybe that is a good thing.

The goal is to create customer-focused institutions that rival that of any business. We mustn’t let inefficiency, mistrust, and bureaucracy get in the way of our real jobs—educating future generations.

So, what follows are some tips for improving the level of customer service we provide to our customers (who include students, their parents, our communities, and even our co-workers).

Think convenience. We all expect self-serve options today. We also expect to be able to get what we need without ever leaving our digital device. That means our schools are held to that same standard. If we expect people  to complete student forms or forms for enrollment or or staff member requirements, those forms must be available online. We should be sure our online information is available at their fingertips and easy to find (or at least in a logical place so their searching isn’t in vain). Being considerate of our customers’ time and effort is just one example of expected customer service in our digital age.

Secret Shopper
Secret shoppers. Begin by testing the customer experience for yourself. Don’t assume that you already know what that is like, but look at your touchpoints from a completely objective viewpoint. Have someone sit down at a computer and ask them to find specific information from your website. Is it intuitive, logical, and current? Or is it frustrating or impossible? Now have your “secret shopper” use the phone tree and see how simple it is to get through to leave a message. See if anyone gets back to them and how friendly and helpful the conversation is when they do speak to someone.
Roll out the welcome mat. Okay, this isn’t just the welcome mat or even just the front office, but it can begin in the parking lot. Is it hard to find? Is there disability access? Are the hours of availability posted both online and on the building and are both correct? Are your grounds clean and neat and the signage welcoming or cluttered and forbidding? What about your office entry? Is it institutional or does it reflect your school spirit with student art, a video slideshow, and a welcoming front office with staff that makes eye contact and welcomes visitors with a sincere smile? Are the words and tone used with customers and one another what it should be?
Be better than “Good Enough.” I’m sure you’ve heard the phrase “ It's good enough for government work,” but today’s standards for the education sector is no different from what feels good enough for any industry. Like it or not, the bar has been raised. Strive for being a Nordstrom and avoid being the DMV. That means being timely and considerate. Doing it right the first time is far better than a belated apology after missing the mark.
Eliminate waiting. Take a look at the ways you make your customers wait. Can they get through on the phone when they call, or are they stuck forever in phone tree hell? Encourage your office staff to grab that phone by the third ring and say hello with a smile to see what a difference it makes on those initial customer service contacts. When someone (student or parent) comes to the front office, how quickly does someone in the office make eye contact and acknowledge them? How quickly do you expect staff to return parent calls? Is there a standard you strive for? If not, make sure there is. 
Own the handoff. Set a standard that when a handoff is needed, whoever is the initial contact recognizes that they own it. This can happen when someone promises something to a customer like “We’ll have his teacher call you,” or “We’ll let the principal know,” or maybe the initial contact doesn’t have the answer and needs to direct the customer to someone else. Whether or not you have the answer or expertise, assuring that the ball didn’t get dropped on the handoff builds trust and provides the kind of customer service you would want to receive if it were you. 

Yield sign entitled My Bad
Admit mistakes. There will be mistakes. They are a fact of life, and your school and staff are not exempt. Sometimes staff will need to apologize for something that wasn’t within their control or was something they had nothing to do with. But an apology, especially one that shows empathy for the customer’s situation, will go a long way toward building bridges of trust (and forgiveness). Having staff comfortable with saying, “I’m so sorry this has happened. Let’s see what we can do to fix this (make it right, solve this, etc.)” is training that will translate into a lot of goodwill.
Get to yes. The goal, in a customer-focused driven school culture, is to find ways to get to yes with your customers. Other than the obvious privacy, safety, and security issues, more times than not, there is a way to get there. Far too often, especially in organizations, the default answer is, “if you call back tomorrow…” or “that isn’t the way it is done here,” or “that isn’t my department.” Your default can easily switch to yes with a bit of encouraged ownership for problem-solving. The “yes” answers to these three examples should be obvious and with a bit of role-modeling, the new norm.
Model, train, hire. Many institutions tend to inadvertently grow, or allow, what the author of High-Tech, High-Touch Customer Service, Micah Solomon, calls “situational tyrants.” These are the folks who have the power to say “no” in their circle of influence and who use that power frequently. Keep these people from undermining your customer service culture efforts by getting them on board with a customer mindset as quickly as possible. This will mean looking for any evidence of their showing that spirit of getting to yes and rewarding that behavior to encourage more of it. Have them help you root out processes that are no longer necessary or are just there “because it has always been done that way.” These folks are often good at implementing improvements when empowered.
Share information that your customer wants. Far too many school websites are filled with content that is about the school and its needs instead of content about what the parents need. Consider regular articles that address topics or contain stories that are about your customers’ needs or wants. It might be a monthly article on a topic that helps parents be parents on a myriad of topics like “quick, nutritious lunches your kids’ friends will envy,” “tips to get your student to share their day’s happenings,” or “preparing your preschooler for a great kindergarten experience.”
Surprise them with good news. This tip mostly applies to teachers, but counselors and coaches could do this as well. Surprise parents with a note, text, or phone call about something their child is doing well—no reason other than you just wanted to share something you noticed that they might enjoy hearing. Ideally, every first contact with parents by teachers should be a positive one, and this is a great customer service standard to make that a reality.
Share examples. Gather and share (regularly) examples of when staff has received (or witnessed) excellent customer service from their co-workers. Create an easy-to-submit process for sharing these examples, and find ways to highlight them at staff meetings, in conversations with staff, on the staff intranet, or in written exchanges. You could begin by asking every staff member to share one great experience of outstanding customer service so you have a pool of examples to draw upon.
Create a contest. As in the above tip, gather great customer service examples from your customers as well. You can turn it into a contest and begin with students. It could be examples they see from staff members or their peers. Share the results on social media. This shows that you value customer service as well as helps others notice such examples (and emulate them).

Ask for feedback
Ask for feedback. While this might sound a bit scary, you can’t fix what you are unaware of, so create ways to get feedback from your customers. This is fairly easy to accomplish with surveys (online, hard copies, through the PTA/PTO, or as part of events like teacher conferences or meet-the-teacher night). Put a feedback form on your website and invite students, staff, and community to contribute. Find out what areas are in need of improvement as well as where you are doing a great job. Share the good news with staff, and work on strengthening the areas of weakness.
Share feedback reactions. Once you’ve received feedback and made improvements, let folks know what you’ve done to incorporate that feedback into your culture or processes. This will not only let people know they are heard but will show evidence that you are reactive and transparent. You’ll build trust and earn future goodwill.
Puttin’ on the Ritz. At the Ritz Carlton, known for their amazing customer service, they have three rules that are easy enough to implement at your school. 1) Start with a warm and sincere greeting, 2) Use their name. Don’t be afraid to ask it if you don’t know, and then use it in the conversation, 3) Leave them with a warm goodbye. These three simple standards are a good place to start if you have nothing in place yet. 
Small acts have a big impact. In K–12 education, everyone involved shares a common purpose (why we are here). But sometimes our individual role in that common purpose can get lost in our day-to-day tasks. When staff understand how their particular role fits into this common purpose, going out of their way to meet and exceed customer expectations no longer feels like an imposition, but an honor. Recognize, model, and encourage small acts of service so everyone will recognize their big impact on your school’s success. (Being friendly, smiling a greeting, starting conversations, asking questions, listening actively, providing assistance, and other simple acts can become the norm.) Let the staff know it is okay to be off-task sometimes when they are serving the common purpose.
First impressions. Take a look at each touchpoint of first impressions, and do some quick clean-up there. How does your school look on the first visit? Is it clean? Inviting? Is the signage clearly marked and friendly? How does your website serve first-time visitors? Do they know what your school does well? Is it inviting and intuitive? How quickly are phone calls answered and guidance provided? Negative first impressions are difficult to reverse, so make them count.
Accepted as a valuable asset. Every member of your staff and even the on-site volunteers should know that school customer service is a valued asset (even an economic asset) rather than an expense or inconvenience. The school leaders must continually demonstrate that this return on investment (of their staff’s time) justifies those short-term costs and will influence attitudes and learning for generations. Each touchpoint matters and is valued.

Recognize your stars
Recognize your stars. Go out of your way to notice and acknowledge the individuals (staff or student) who exemplify good customer service. Share those stories with others to show that you value that behavior. Reward those behaviors, and you’ll begin to see more of the same.
Just get started. Effective school customer service always begins with a customer-focused mindset. School staff must see their individual roles as vital to the school’s success as well as see the benefits it can provide to them personally. Customer service attitudes are the outward expression of your school’s culture. Its impact on student learning, and their willingness to learn, is obvious. The support your school enjoys from the community as a whole is also, in large part, affected by how you value customer service measures. 

So, is it worth the investment of time and training? You bet it is!

Start anywhere, but start today.","I totally agree with you on the need to ‘own the handoff’  It's such an underrated part of customer service. What’s the most common mistake you see companies making when it comes to education?

42,stacy.williams@simucase.com,"Stacy!?!Simucase!?!With the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), students, faculty, and staff at Illinois State University were forced to transition their work and learning to online platforms. One platform, Simucase, allowed graduate students in Communication Sciences and Disorders to continue earning clinical clock hours even though the university clinic and some off-campus sites have closed their doors.

Simucase is an online learning platform that “allows users to observe, assess, diagnose, and provide intervention for virtual patients.” After completing a Simucase simulation, students debrief with their assigned clinical educator, reflecting on the case, what was learned, and what they might have done differently.

“While  It's not ideal to use Simucase the rest of this semester, it is great technology graduate clinicians can use to continue earning hours,” said Gianna Delia, a first-year graduate student in speech-language pathology.

Students can earn up to 75 clock hours through Simucase. “I have received over 12 hours in just the first two weeks of online courses,” Delia said.

Anna Yates, a second-year graduate student in speech-language pathology, was in the process of completing an internship at a dual-language school in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Since she can no longer attend her internship, Simucase has allowed her to finish the required clock hours for graduation this spring.

“Luckily, I only needed 20 minutes of additional clinical experience,” said Yates. “It would have been incredibly frustrating and disheartening to come within 20 minutes of my clinical clock hour requirement without any alternatives for supplementation.”

With the increase in students’ Simucase use due to COVID-19, Illinois State University recently received the top score for the variety of Simucase simulations completed in a week. “I am thankful we already had Simucase in place prior to the move to online learning. This put us at a huge advantage as the students were already familiar with how to navigate the platform,” Director of Clinical Education in Speech-Language Pathology Cara Boester said. “Our team of clinical educators provided a great framework for this situation. I’m very happy with the transition and response to the increased use of Simucase during this unprecedented time.”","The work that Simucase is doing to keep clinicians learning right now is amazing!

Duda Named Website Builder Leader In G2 Summer 2020 Grid® Report

Duda announced today that it has been named a Leader in G2’s Summer 2020 Grid® Report for Website Builders. This report is based on customer reviews, and the report noted that the Duda professional website builder platform gathered high marks in a wide number of business relationship traits including “quality of support” and “ease of doing business,” along with ease of use, ease of administration, and ease of setup.

“Duda is the white label website design platform that has been chosen by thousands of agencies and SaaS platforms over the past decade,” said Itai Sadan, CEO of Duda. “This ranking from G2 acknowledges the traits that users of the Duda professional website builder can rely on and, just as importantly, the focus on customer relationships that Duda holds dear as we serve our global customers.” 

The G2 rankings are based on reviews from actual customers, and the reviews have been verified by G2. Duda received more than 130 reviews in the Website Builder category and scored an astonishing 91% from reviewers in the area of “likely to recommend” — higher than WordPress.com, Wix, and Squarespace.

Here’s what Duda’s customers had to say:
“ It's like having an online superpower. Great platform to grow an agency, manage clients and sell products.”
“I've been most pleased with their outstanding customer support. Any time I have a question, either simple or complex, an agent reaches out promptly to aid. [...] Prior to moving my clients to Duda, I did website development on other rival companies that provide a similar service (3 to be exact), without any hesitation, I would recommend Duda for large and small agencies alike. Outstanding!”
“Duda's website builder is intuitive and easy to use. I previously used WordPress and had to constantly worry about upgrades, bugs, and fixes.”
“Duda is amazing, so easy for me to build sites quickly without having to worry about painful coding nightmares. They are constantly releasing new updates and their preset designs look so good! [...] The Support staff has been friendly and helpful. When I had issues, they were there responding quickly to address my concerns and trouble-shoot with me. The marketing collateral and white label slide decks have made selling Duda websites pain free. They have all the product details there for me to keep my client informed.”
“Duda is by far the best tool out there for web designers.”

35,arthur.pereless@pereless.com,"Arthur!?!Pereless Systems!?!We have come so far in technological advancement that it is hard to remember the way things were. In 1999, the idea of signing digital documents was hard to imagine. Twenty years later, e-signature technology has proven to be a great technological innovation.

History Of Electronic Signatures

Electronic signatures, also known as e-signatures are “any electronic process that indicates acceptance of an agreement or record.” Unlike digital signatures that use a certificate-based ID, electronic signatures use a single-factor authorization using variables like passwords, unique PINS and Social Security numbers to verify identity. Proof of signing is achieved using an audit trail function embedded within each digital page.

Digital signature technology has existed since the start of the new millennium. In 2000, the United States passed the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN) which established that e-signatures share the validity of an ink signature and are an acceptable method for document execution in every U.S. state and territory.

Solving Old Problems With New Tech

Electronic signatures have become essential to workflow improvement. The federal government even passed a law in 2018, “The 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act” mandating it “modernize its websites, forms, and processes for improved user experience and compliance with legal standards,” which included ""a plan to accelerate the use of electronic signatures standards established under the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.”

When our company integrated e-signature technology into our applicant tracking software, it made processes much simpler for us. Veteran recruiters remember a time when new hire paperwork was filled out with an ink pen, in person, and then categorized and stored in filing cabinets. The time it took to track progress and obtain signatures, and storing and purchasing the required materials could be costly. Most importantly for hiring teams, e-signature tech provides a seamless experience for candidates navigating prehire and onboarding phases.

PROMOTED",I noticed you mentioned the challenges you faced integrating e-signature technology into our applicant tracking software. What would you have done differently if you were doing it now?,
34,jfotta@gryphonnetworks.com,"Jeffrey!?!Gryphon Networks!?!The days of sales management based on guesswork and manually entered reports are changing. Specifically, forecasts not based on data are becoming obsolete as managing with sales metrics has become the new standard. After all, the technology that exists today is too powerful for sales managers not to employ – especially when it comes to managing daily activity.

Sales acceleration technology allows managers to view their team’s activity in real time, enabling them to locate any problem areas their reps may have and provide better coaching. This also gives managers insights into the metrics that are most important to making their reps more efficient. Additionally, metrics give reps the information they need to fine-tune their outreach and know where they stand amongst their teammates. Due to these benefits, the most successful sales organizations are managing with sales metrics to gain unprecedented insights into daily sales activity and give reps the tools they need to succeed.

Managing with Sales Metrics

Eliminating forecasting inaccuracies is a top challenge that managers face today. Recent data reports that only 50% of salespeople base their forecasts on data-driven insights. Traditionally, managers have used CRMs to process leads and opportunities, but your CRM is not always the most accurate tool on its own. While a CRM can be effective when used to track and organize pipelines, sales managers should constantly be on the lookout for new ways to project wins and losses and get their team to adopt the same processes across the board.

It is incredibly important for managers to have historical and/or comparative data at their disposal to better coach and uncover issues struggling reps may be experiencing. Having access to 100% accurate data enables managers to set expectations— and provides them with the information they need to coach struggling reps and train new hires.

Implementing Analytics

The reality is that high performing teams are 2.1X more likely than underperforming teams to have fully integrated data systems. Therefore, implementing a sales tool to more accurately manage and train reps is a manager’s best tool to improve team performance.

Applying analytics to customer calls allows managers to track patterns of rep behavior. From there, specific, successful behaviors can be highlighted and replicated amongst reps. Analytics provided by a sales acceleration tool help managers quickly identify the strengths and weaknesses of their reps, and let them provide coaching as soon as it is needed. Further, onboarding time is reduced as managers can provide new hires with data-driven blueprints for success from the get-go.

In addition to improving management, metrics provided by a sales tool serve to benefit reps by giving them a better understanding of their performance and areas where they could improve. These metrics let reps see which days of the week and times of day their outreach is most successful, how many outreach attempts they should be making to prospects to set an appointment, and so on. Further, giving reps accessible data at their fingertips can serve as a source of healthy competition and motivation for your team members.

A Tool for Managers and Reps

The bottom line is that, in order to alleviate the challenges of managing a sales team and hitting quota based on guesstimated forecasts, it is time to challenge existing and outdated internal process and begin managing with sales metrics. Every time a rep reaches out to a prospect, they are producing data that is yours to use or lose. Sales analytics will allow you to mold new hires into revenue-generating team members, ensure that your team is working towards a common goal, and surpass previously guesstimated quotas with hard-hitting numbers.

32,jamesw@needcomputerhelp.com,"James!?!Need Computer Help!?!Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more common as the business world continues doing more online. It can seem like every time you turn on the news, there’s another major company announcing they were hit by a ransomware attack or data breach. 

These stories of high-profile companies being the victim of hacks can give small business owners a false sense of security, thinking criminals only go after big fish. However, small businesses need to be on the lookout for ransomware attacks, too. According to Verizon’s 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report, 43 percent of breaches involved small businesses. 

While the thought of trying to defend your business from hackers can feel overwhelming, there are ways to reduce the risk of becoming a victim. Here are four tips for keeping your small business safe from ransomware attacks. 

   1. Educate Your Employees
All it takes for a hacker to gain access to your network is one employee opening a phishing email and clicking on the wrong link. By teaching your employees safe web surfing practices, they’ll be less likely to open those unsolicited emails or download software from shady websites. 

   2. Limit Administrative Access
How many employees have administrative access to your entire network? If that number is more than a select few, then you need to start limiting privileges. No users should be granted admin access unless they need it.

   3. Keep Your System Updated
Don’t ignore the prompts to update your software. Hackers often target vulnerabilities in older versions of computer programs. The easiest way to prevent that from happening is to keep your system patched and updated with the latest program version. 

  4. Audit User Access
Whenever an employee leaves your company,  It's good practice to remove their user accounts from your network. Many businesses forget to clean up their user account lists. Develop a routine of deleting user accounts on the employee’s last day. This will help prevent hackers from using these accounts to spread malware or cause data breaches. 

By following these four tips, you can immediately reduce the risk of your small business being affected by a cybersecurity attack. However, keeping your network safe can be a time-consuming task. If time is an issue, then let us take care of your tech.

How We Can Help
We are the IT experts you need to keep your essential data safe from digital threats now and into the future.

Alongside classwork, Cipher Tech began to bridge the gap between the nation’s best academics and students, and the defense community. Just a few years later, in true “David and Goliath” fashion, Cipher Tech became known as a fierce competitor by defense and intelligence firms many times our size.

Today we, as a company, take great pride in supporting many of the most mission critical projects within the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community. The majority of the company is comprised of extremely talented software developers who write production tools that directly support one of two missions: digital forensics and malware reverse engineering.

Digital forensics is the application of computer science and investigative procedures involving the examination of digital evidence. This includes extracting and processing evidence from computers, phones, tablets, cameras, flash-drives, and just about any other form of digital media. The results of our work are then used to support federal and military law enforcement, counter-intelligence, and counter-terrorist activities.

Malware reverse engineering is the practice of analyzing extremely advanced malicious code. The goal of a reverse engineer is to understand how the malicious code is working and determine things like: how it infected the victim’s computer; what kind of information is it seeking to steal; how is it communicating with the actor; and who that actor might be.

30,frank.pellkofer@utelogy.com,"Frank!?!Utelogy!?!LOS ANGELES, Feb. 5, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Utelogy Corporation, a visionary provider of control, monitoring and analytics software for workspace management, today announced its automation tool, U-Automate. This module delivers the Room Readiness feature, which enables IT teams to remotely validate the readiness of all connected devices, sensors, etc., in its workspaces. These powerful features will be available for demonstration at Integrated Systems Europe (ISE 2020) February 11 to 14.

Ensuring collaboration spaces remain optimized and running at scale to deliver a positive user experience in today's enterprise environment is a daunting task.

Utelogy's management portal, U-Manage, released last year, already allows operations teams to drill down to see device metrics, documents, and events for all of its connected devices under a single pane of glass. U-Automate is a productivity tool designed to eliminate the costly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive manual processes enterprises employ today to confirm each conference room and the devices in those rooms are online and functioning properly.

U-Automate delivers the following features to improve efficiency for the IT organization:

Build scripts by configuring blocks with the ability to enter custom parameters
Test devices, video and audio calls, state checks, custom macros and more
Schedule scripts to execute and repeat at any date, time and location
Review test logs to pro-actively address errors and warnings
""We know that companies spend millions of dollars every year on manual room checks.  With U-Automate, operations teams can leverage the technology to reduce labor costs by as much as 75%,"" said Kevin Morrison, CEO of Utelogy. ""Automating the repetitive tasks allows companies to reassign those resources to more strategic, core business activities,"" added Morrison.

Automation not only delivers productivity gains for the operations team, but also for employees using the meeting room technology.  When workplace technology functions the way  It's supposed to, it allows employees to focus on the productive, valuable human work, allowing companies to attract and retain the best employees.

Utelogy's U-Automate lays the groundwork for future development efforts targeted to take advantage of machine learning to deliver Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can drive automation features that would include self-healing scenarios.

""Let's assume the AI engine has determined there's a 75 per cent chance a projector issue can be resolved with a reboot.  The system could assess whether there are people currently in the room or scheduled to come into the room. If the next meeting is in 10 minutes, and the system knows the projector has a three-minute reboot, it could automatically reboot the projector without any human interaction.  We believe self-healing is a key benefit of AI, and we expect that to provide immense business value in the future,"" Morrison explained.

Room Readiness, powered by U-Automate, will be available for demonstration at Integrated Systems Europe 2020 (ISE 2020) February 11 to 14, 2020 at the RAI in Amsterdam. Utelogy will be in Hall 14 Stand M-170 and interested parties can schedule a demonstration here https://www.utelogy.com/utelogy-demo-ise-2020/.

Mytonomy’s digital front door is supporting major health systems across the country, including Carilion Clinic, Hackensack Meridian Health, Mass General Brigham, and Rush University Medical Center, as well as multiple remote patient care clinics and monitoring programs.

“Mytonomy is an integral part of our larger digital front door strategy,” said Mike Dame, Vice President, Marketing and Communications at Carilion Clinic. “Mytonomy has helped us quickly create and deliver high-quality medical education videos to patients on any screen faster and less expensively than we could on our own. The partnership has allowed our internal video team to focus on storytelling and marketing our services.”

Mytonomy took home 19 awards at the recent Telly Awards, five of which are focused on orthopedic procedures, including knee replacements. These are now available as part of an on-demand library of more than 80 videos, all created by Mytonomy’s in-house studio. Other companies honored at the Telly awards include broadcast media companies such as Sony Music, BBC, and Disney, as well as leaders in patient education such as Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and United Healthcare.

Mytonomy is rapidly becoming a major player in virtual care delivering health information at scale that’s clinically accurate, evidence-based, and peer-reviewed through their novel CRM platform. At the heart of Mytonomy is the Patient Experience Cloud™ offering a tailored concierge experience, helping patients consider new treatment options, prepare for a procedure or coaching visit, get ready for discharge, and manage home health. This personalized engagement at scale is enabled by a series of modern enterprise cloud software modules and an advanced data model to drive a digital health training platform.

“High-quality content plus modern enterprise SaaS is a force multiplier in helping patients engage virtually. As health care systems grapple with unprecedented challenges during this time — whether they live in places that are seeing COVID-19 spikes or in places that have already brought back elective procedures — we are there to support them with our award-winning video content and our CRM platform,” said Anjali Kataria, CEO and co-founder of Mytonomy.

Mytonomy’s 1500 originally produced microlearning videos helps providers meet patients where they are virtually and ensures they have the knowledge they need to manage their health by preparing properly for elective procedures and ultimately discharging faster, with less complications, lower infection rates, fewer calls into the call center after discharge, and streamlined interactions across the patient journey, ultimately improving the bottom line for health systems and improving the quality of life for patients. Mytonomy has also helped remote patient monitoring programs become more efficient.

“We could not be prouder to deliver medical content that’s consumable and truly making health care more accessible for more people, whether  It's an expecting mother preparing for childbirth, or an injured athlete planning for an orthopedic procedure,” said Vinay Bhargava, president and co-founder of Mytonomy.

A recent report by McKinsey highlighted that the demand for virtual care continues to increase, and hospitals are investing in permanent virtual care infrastructure like Mytonomy, taking lessons from the pandemic to be resilient in the face of any future crises.

Mytonomy’s Patient Experience Cloud™ can be fully administered “out of the box” to support any condition across the enterprise, like joint programs with urgent needs, in 48 hours. It can also be configured to each program’s individual brand and program specifics, and integrated into EMRs, apps, and websites in six-to-eight weeks.

Additional content categories that took home Telly awards included diabetes self-management, bariatric surgery, statins, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and several winners in the proper use of opioids and pain management as part of surgery and trauma care.

26,chandra@egrabber.com,"Chandra!?!eGrabber!?!Due to COVID pandemic, companies are expected to outsource more work, says NTT – a technology firm . The ‘2020 Global Managed Services Report’, based on a survey of 1,250 executives in 29 countries, said that 45% organizations will outsource more  in the next 18 months, with 57% citing security risks as a key challenge for managing IT in-house. In this environment, the delivery of platform-enabled solutions becomes even more important, it said.

COVID has created a new wave of Fast-Growing companies – a lot of them fairly unknown before this crisis. To close sales in this “new normal”, you need to target companies that have budgets to hire and expand.

Companies with budgets are hiring employees who would start by being remote. They are also taking a big risk because they are hiring without the traditional in-person chemistry & culture fit interview.

These companies that are hiring are dealing with processes they wished they have automated before most of their employees had started to work from home. These circumstances will lead many companies to open up towards automation of their work processes. So, in the future, companies may be more likely to outsource their IT or business processes.

This could be the best time for outsourcing companies like you to pitch these managers who are hiring remote teams , “Since you are hiring remote employees without seeing them anyway, why not give us a chance? We are less risk & can start today!” You might offer to start with two or three people immediately. The companies can try them & pick the best person for long term work. You can tell them, you know the people on your team have the skills. You can position yourselves to be the fastest & lowest risk option.

We have seen this strategy work for several outsourcing companies. We hope it can work for you, if you too are selling outsourcing services. Here are 3 steps that will help you to build a list of fast growing companies that have budgets and are hiring.

3 Steps to build your lead list of companies to target
Step 1: Research Job Boards
This step involves a lot of manual efforts to compile the most recent job postings that is hiring the skill & talent you provide from dozens of Job Boards. Shortlist the companies that are hiring in the USA. To ensure that you have a very exhaustive list of companies, search jobs by US States / Regions and Job Titles.

Step 2: Eliminate Duplicate companies
You will find many duplicate companies, remove them from the list. Repetition of companies in the list happens due to any of the following:

A company could have posted multiple job positions
A company could have posted the same job position in multiple Job Boards
Job Boards displaying the same company name differently. For instance,
HP vs Hewlett Packard vs Hewlett Packard Enterprise
eGrabber vs eGrabber Inc.
Brand name vs Company name
Step 3: Include Company Demographics
In order to prioritize and make your sales pitch easier, Add company demographics such as Industry, Company Headcount, Timezone, Location, Website URL and Company LinkedIn ID.

The lead list you build this way will get you more appointments than any random lead list. If you want to automate the entire process listed above, you can use Hiring Prospector Tool from eGrabber.

Common-sense solution from Publix

Publix bought surplus milk and produce that farmers were dumping and donated it to Feeding America food banks like our own Feeding Northeast Florida.

Farmers have thrown out milk and plowed under crops since the demand for food for schools and restaurants plummeted with the closures brought on by the coronavirus. Meanwhile, demand for food at food banks has skyrocketed because of layoffs and furloughs.

We applaud Publix for finding this solution.

Testing expands to Northside

It also is good to see the expansion of coronavirus testing to the Northwest Jax. UF Health Jacksonville offered free tests in the Soutel Drive area, which has a large elderly population, many with underlying conditions that make them especially vulnerable to the virus.

Although the city has had testing sites in the Downtown area, many people have transportation issues. The city needs to do more extensive testing throughout our large county so that we can get a handle on the actual number of cases we have.

VITAL visitation for elderly

One of the more heart-wrenching situations that has arisen during the pandemic is the plight of people in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Several of these facilities have become hotspots for the virus. In an effort to protect residents and staff, a number of the facilities have restricted visitation, which has been difficult on families.

Now, the Alzheimer’s Association is teaming up with the state Department of Elder Affairs in a new program called VITAL (Virtual Inclusion Technology for All) to provide virtual visitation opportunities using a tablet.

Easy-to-use tables from iN2L will be supplied to nursing homes and assisted living facilities around the state. The tablets have one-touch video chat tools for virtual family visits, as well as over 1,000 apps to engage the residents.

The project involves 150 senior communities, which each will receive two tablets and training on how to use them. Eight senior communities in Jacksonville, Orange Park, Fleming Island, St. Augustine and Fernandina Beach will receive the tablets in the first phase of the project.

This is another common-sense solution to provide emotional support and comfort to the elderly, many of whom have dementia, and their families.

23,abhishek@tookitaki.com,"Abhishek!?!Tookitaki!?!The biggest challenge, or rather what is perceived as a great challenge, to anti-money laundering (AML) bodies though has been the innovation and rise in Cryptocurrencies in the recent past. Many governments have expressed apprehensions about the use of Cryptocurrencies due to the fact that they appear to be unregulated and pose a higher perceived risk for money laundering and other illegal financial activities.

Seth Klarman: Investors Can No Longer Rely On Mean Reversion
Volatility""For most of the last century,"" Seth Klarman noted in his second-quarter letter to Baupost's investors, ""a reasonable approach to assessing a company's future prospects was to expect mean reversion."" He went on to explain that fluctuations in business performance were largely cyclical, and investors could profit from this buying low and selling high. Also Read More


So are cryptocurrencies actually more conducive to money laundering than traditional financial institutions? Tookitaki, a RegTech firm that builds aml software, sought to answer this question. They have gathered a list of the biggest cases of money laundering on record in the USA over the past decade. Their analysis has split up the cases based on financial institutions/ banks and cryptocurrencies to give a comparative view of the two platforms in a quantitative manner.

What’s interesting to see is that while the most money laundered through a traditional financial institution -- Waschovia Bank, amounts to $390 Billion, the highest amount of money laundered using cryptocurrencies in the past decade is a meager $177 million. Tookitaki’s analysis also mentions that the total amount of money laundered by traditional banks is about $2 Trillion per year. The total amount of money laundered per year through cryptocurrencies -- which is an estimated $2.8 Billion -- doesn’t really stack up.

It seems that the numbers prove that the assumption of cryptocurrencies being unsafe in comparison to traditional banks may be deeply flawed. Take a look at the complete infographic below to learn more:

Money Laundering",I read Tookitaki's report on money laundering channels - are cryptos more or less susceptible to it than traditional financial institutions..was very interesting to see that traditional institutions are still far more prone to laundering than cryptos are. Do you think this will always be the case or are cryptos overly 'feared' in this manner? ,

This time around, Microsoft purchased Elevate HR's new Advanced Benefits Administration and Enhanced Employee Open Enrollment Experience IP to include within Dynamics 365.

""The IP acquisitions announced today will support our customers throughout their transformation journey, breaking down people data silos and providing a centralized view of the workforce, as well as automating key tasks that may have historically been done on paper or using Microsoft Excel...These new capabilities will greatly enhance our ability to help HR teams drive operational excellence across these critical employee experiences"" – Muhammad Alam, Microsoft General Manager, Dynamics 365

Elevate HR customers, like Sevan Multi-Site Solutions, choose Microsoft + Elevate HR to support their rapid expansion, build an empowerment culture, bring down operating costs and bolster an employee-first ethos:

“We have four main pillars in our company—people, clients, operations, and finance —and people always come first. Deploying Talent was a strategic decision that fits within our long-term roadmap of accelerated global expansion, and  It's already starting to pay off.  We’ve seen Microsoft devote considerable resources to expand and enhance the product to make it a diverse human resources solution. These new investments are a great example of that effort and help position our team for future growth in the Multi-Site construction industry.”  – Chris Galazka, Vice President of Human Resources, Sevan Multi-Site Solutions

The following Elevate HR apps will soon be available out-of-the-box in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent & Human Resources:

Elevate HR Advanced Benefits Management  

There’s a strong correlation between benefits, hiring, and retention: organizations need to develop and manage highly competitive benefits programs to attract and retain the best employees. Managing these programs requires highly configurable systems that help companies leverage the value of benefits they provide to their employees. This key investment will help our customers manage complex benefit programs, including tiered benefit rates, flex credit management, complex eligibility rules, and auto-enrollment features. We will also provide benefit managers with the ability to integrate employee and enrollment information with their benefit providers.  

Elevate HR Employee Enrollment Experience 

Today’s benefits are flexible, personalized, and plentiful. An engaging benefit enrollment portal dramatically improves the employee experience and increases satisfaction with employer benefit programs. Employees will have an intuitive “retail” experience, with concepts of item selection, product detail forms, shopping carts, and easy dependent/beneficiary handling. Our investment in self-service features for new hire enrollments, real-time life events, and open enrollment cycles will free up HR departments to focus on strategic projects that impact the business.  

Additional features soon to be available in Dynamics 365 include Timesheets and enhanced support for complex Leave & Absence policies.",Congrats on yet another buy from Microsoft - are you privy to when the new appliations will be available in Dynamics 365? Looking forward to it!,
19,david@vanillasoft.com,"David!?!VanillaSoft!?!As the new man in charge of growing sales at a company that exists to do exactly that for its customers, Darryl Praill knows the pressure is on.

“If the revenue numbers don’t hit, they always look at you,” says Praill, the newly appointed chief revenue officer at VanillaSoft, a software firm with a major presence in Gatineau.

Although the company is based in Texas, most of its top executives, including Praill and CEO David Hood, live in the National Capital Region. About 50 of VanillaSoft’s 75 employees work in the Ottawa area, where they’ve spearheaded the development of a sales engagement platform that’s quietly carved out a sizeable market niche.

In a nutshell, VanillaSoft’s subscription-based software is designed to help clients boost sales by generating potential leads and continuously prompting sales reps to follow up with phone calls, emails, texts or messages on social media sites such as LinkedIn. 

Praill – who joined VanillaSoft almost three years ago as chief marketing officer after previous stints at a variety of tech firms including Cognos – says market research suggests that most reps take at least three days to contact potential customers and fail to follow up on nearly half of all leads they receive. 

He says VanillaSoft tries to ensure that sales reps are “productive 100 per cent of the time, not 35 per cent of the time” and are using all the resources at their disposal to turn potential clients into signed customers.

“If you spent $10,000 on a trade show and you generated 500 leads, you don’t want to ignore 300 of them,” he explains. “You want to call them all.”

VanillaSoft, which landed a $3-million capital investment from Quebec’s Fonds régionaux de solidarité FTQ Outaouais in the spring of 2019, battles toe-to-toe with U.S. behemoths such as Atlanta’s SalesLoft and Seattle-based Outreach ​– both of which have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in funding. 

“And yet here we are, kicking ass, competing and doing very, very well,” Praill says, noting that the privately held firm’s revenues have consistently grown between 30 and 40 per cent annually for the past several years. “For me, this is fun.”

'No one’s talking about us'
VanillaSoft’s local headcount has nearly doubled since last year, and the new chief revenue officer says he doesn’t think the company gets the credit it deserves for being a major player in the country’s SaaS sector.

“We’ve got a company here in Gatineau that no one knows about because we’re in Gatineau,” he says. “No one’s talking about us.”

While revenues at the firm, which bills its 4,000 customers by the month, dipped slightly when the COVID-19 pandemic began, Praill says that cratering sales in industries such as tourism and hospitality were largely offset by gains in other sectors, including insurance and hospitality.

And although marketing software firms such as HubSpot found that the volume of deals dropped 30 per cent or more after the coronavirus hit, Praill says activity on VanillaSoft’s platform fell just seven per cent for the first few weeks, then bounced back. 

“Our software is helping (companies) survive COVID,” he says. “I see the impact it has on organizations every day.”

Praill says he expects to start chasing more venture capital once the economy is back on surer footing. VanillaSoft still has plenty of room to grow, he adds, noting the company has actually added 10 employees since the COVID-19 crisis began. 

The past Forty Under 40 recipient says he’s “jazzed” about effectively being the No. 2 man at a company that he believes is more vital to its customers now than ever.

“This is a hot space,” he says. “I’m having a blast.”","Glad to read that things are going well for yourselves during this pandemic. Curious to know, how do you guys differ from Outreach (our current platform)?",

In addition, 90% of adults agree that these conversations positively influence youth to make informed decisions about these critical issues.

May is Talking is Power Month, a national effort to spark meaningful conversations between young people and the parents and champions, such as an aunt, uncle, grandparent or mentor, who care about them. The focus of Power to Decide's #TalkingIsPower campaign reminds parents and champions how powerful they are in the lives of young people. #TalkingIsPower campaign asks this year, ""Have you talked to a young person today?""

""Without question these trying times have upended every part of our daily lives,"" said Gillian Sealy, CEO, Power to Decide. ""For families, sheltering has meant increased opportunities to have conversations that can positively influence youth to make informed decisions about their lives including sex, love, relationships and ultimately birth control.""

According to an additional survey commissioned by Power to Decide, more than two-thirds of adults say, as teens, they had someone to talk with about these topics. Among those who had someone to talk to, 60% reported talking to parents, 58% to a friend, 35% to a significant other and 23% to a sibling. The overwhelming majority of adult respondents (85%) cited being able to get information they needed to access birth control. Interview responses were collected from a national telephone survey conducted in April 2020 with more than 500 men and women age 18 and older.

""We have the gift of time with the young people in our life to have thoughtful conversations that will impact their life trajectory and support their power to decide if, when and under what circumstances to get pregnant and have a child,"" Sealy added. ""Let's use this time with our young people and seize the moment. Talking is power.""

6,derek@cardflight.com,"Derek!?!CardFlight!?!-CardFlight, the leading SaaS payment technology company, today released the results of a new survey documenting the impact of COVID-19 on U.S. small businesses. Responses from nearly 250 business owners and employees nationwide paint a sobering picture of the challenges these businesses have faced since the virus first emerged, and what may lie in store for them ahead.

“Our customers are true small businesses — CardFlight merchants typically have one to ten employees and less than five locations or mobile service points”

“Small business owners are known for their resilience and ability to adapt, but the environment they’ve been forced into in just a few short months is nothing short of heartbreaking,” said Derek Webster, CardFlight Founder and CEO. “While the road ahead remains uncertain,  It's uplifting to see how these merchants have survived thus far in the face of adversity and pivoted their business models to keep serving their customers and employees while staying safe. Their tenacity is needed now more than ever, and we’re humbled and grateful to work alongside them as they move forward.”

Among the top findings:

Biggest Impact:
75% of respondents experienced a loss of revenue since March
33% reported having issues with their suppliers
21% had to lay off or furlough their staff within Q2

Shutdown Guidelines
33% of respondents maintained a physical location but had to change operations to stay compliant
32% didn’t operate at all due to local restrictions
More than half (55%) were considered essential businesses.
Entrepreneurial Mindset
To stay afloat, 72% of businesses moved to contactless payment methods
66% adopted curbside pickup or delivery
60% offered relief to customers through reduced fees, delayed billing, waived costs
Looking at the near term, loss of revenue was noted as the biggest threat over the next six months, with 35% of respondents citing this as their top concern. Economic uncertainty was their second largest threat (18%), followed by fear of the virus and another local shutdown (13% each).

When asked to predict the most significant post-COVID impact on small businesses, respondents again cited loss of revenue, with nearly one in four (24%) selecting this as the largest long-term consequence. Closing of business was the second largest long-term concern (12%).

“Our customers are true small businesses — CardFlight merchants typically have one to ten employees and less than five locations or mobile service points,” said Mr. Webster. “We take pride in being able to help these merchants continue to operate through our SwipeSimple payment software, which has allowed our customers to easily and securely transition their business models to suit local public health guidelines due to its ability to accept payments in all ways business owners might need: mobile, in-store, and on the computer.”

4,jim.johnson@mobilesolutions.net,"James!?!Mobile Solutions!?!2020 has been a year of tremendous change. From a global pandemic to social movements, we have all felt the shift. And for many of us, we probably weren’t prepared. As we have learned, adjusting to the new normal is a constantly shifting target. 

To put it simply, no one really knows what will happen next. 

Despite all this change, and all the challenges it brings, people everywhere are more active than ever. Teachers are adapting classrooms to mobile for more than 400 million students. Kitchen tables and living room couches replaced offices as businesses transitioned to enable work from home.  

Because despite all this change, life goes on. 

And as we contemplate what may come next, ask yourself; am I prepared for the future? For those students and end users operating remote, a seamless wireless connection empowers them to engage with the communities and jobs that connect us all. 

For organizations looking to gain control of delivering a wireless connection, solutions are necessary. Basic mobile hotspots, used to deliver internet to remote locations or workers, lack manageability in terms of locating and remote configuration by administrators. This can leave your valuable mobile endpoints vulnerable.  

 

Mobile Solutions’ Android as a Mobile Hotspot provides you with greater control of your mobile endpoints. Android devices when configured as managed mobile hotspots can provide an administrator with:  

Location tracking – know where your devices are located at all times. 
Remote WiFi configuration – such as WiFi SSID/Network Name, passcode.   
Secure control – easily block these devices from being used as hotspots, without suspending or cancelling service, allowing the device to remain manageable.","Having a strong wireless network has never been more imperitive than it is right now!

The EMPI, which replaced the HIE's legacy IBM Initiate software, plays a significant role in UHIN's mission to digitally transform their enterprise to create a secure and modernized network of reliable and readily available patient information. 

NextGate's EMPI quickly integrates, cleanses, and de-duplicates patient information throughout UHIN's network of 25,000 provider participants, which include Intermountain Healthcare and University of Utah Health. As a full-service healthcare clearinghouse, the HIE network currently encompasses more than 214 million claims records and 6 million clinical patient records across the state. UHIN enables electronic medical records exchange and direct secure messaging services for 95 percent of hospitals and 90 percent of large clinics in Utah.

NextGate's EMPI as-a-service aggregates and organizes demographic and medical information to empower providers with a longitudinal patient record for coordinated and informed care decisioning.

""As the nation continues to contend with the impacts of COVID-19, UHIN has taken distinct measures to ensure that our members have immediate access to quality data at the highest level,"" said Cody Johansen, Director of HIE Services at UHIN.

Ensuring that each individual has one and only one record, UHIN is now able to facilitate a sustainable network of accurate patient information across multiple electronic medical record and health information systems for streamlined collaboration and trusted data exchange. The EMPI also impacts UHIN's ability to map a patient's entire care history for population-based analytics and quality reporting for members participating in value-based care initiatives.

""Poor patient identification makes for inefficient and unstable conditions across the industry. The current, unfortunate circumstances of COVID-19 emphasize how vital it is to the health of organizations, patients and public health,"" said Andy Aroditis, CEO of NextGate. ""We are honored to support UHIN's long tradition of excellence and innovation with an EMPI solution that has delivered on its promise of delivering trusted, real-time patient data, anytime, anywhere.""

Previously only available in Europe, the Elite Turf POWER system combines Act Global’s triple-fiber woven Xtreme Turf and a non-rubber infill developed to create a first-of-its-kind product that is recyclable while enhancing safety, playability and durability.

“We are very excited to partner with Elite Turf and its management team. Our combined strengths will deliver premium synthetic turf systems that are built with both the players and planet in mind. Our Xtreme Turf with Elite Turf’s POWER approach makes an excellent choice for communities and clubs alike.”

“Over the past 20 years, the social and market drivers for greater turf innovation related to environmental, sustainability and player safety factors have significantly increased. Athletic facilities, public and private institutions, and athletes and their families can now rest easy knowing that they’re investing and playing on a completely recyclable turf product that’s safer for the environment, safer for the player, and performs better,” said Paul Adams, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Elite Turf. “We’re proud to partner with a global leader in the market, Act Global, to bring this top-of-the-line, eco-friendly Xtreme Turf product currently only available overseas to the U.S. at a time when player safety and our impact on the environment are more important than ever.”

Elite Turf’s POWER System encompasses a woven turf which is stronger and more durable than traditional tufted turf.  It's built on the ProPlay® pad Foundation, which plays and feels firm while testing soft, reducing injuries. With no polyurethane backing, the synthetic turf is 100% recyclable at end of life, reducing the high disposal cost, and its interlocked fibers stand vertical, offering superior and consistent ball roll, steady footing, and reduced glare and heat. The POWER System also provides a safer and healthier infill that’s not only better for athletes, but better for the environment. Derived from up to 40,000 pounds of ocean plastic, the patent-pending infill can remove 1.8 million bottles from the ocean per field. Lastly, the high water permeability of the woven backing combined with the Elite POWER Drainage system which drains more than 2x faster than other fields results in more playable hours.

Act Global CEO John Baize comments, “We are very excited to partner with Elite Turf and its management team. Our combined strengths will deliver premium synthetic turf systems that are built with both the players and planet in mind. Our Xtreme Turf with Elite Turf’s POWER approach makes an excellent choice for communities and clubs alike.”
